This design document outlines a short-form, experimental game titled "Kill Process: The Architecture of Forgetting."

1. Title & Hook
Title: Kill Process: The Architecture of Forgetting Hook: You are a system-level cleanup utility inside a dying mind; to stop the crash, you must manually delete the memories causing the "System Overload."

2. Core Insight
The game explores the utility of forgetting. Humans often view memory loss as a tragedy, but this game frames it as a survival mechanism. It asks: How much of yourself are you willing to erase to keep functioning? It forces the player to become the architect of their own emptiness, transforming the act of "winning" (keeping the system running) into the act of "losing" (erasing identity).

3. Mechanic-narrative integration
Primary Mechanic: Navigating a simulated file directory via a terminal interface using three commands: ls (list memories), cd (enter a year/category), and rm (delete a specific memory).

The Integration: The "monsters" in this game are Memory Leak processes. These processes spawn thousands of junk files (e.g., pain_001.log, guilt_042.tmp) that fill the screen and slow the terminal's response time. To lower the "System Strain," the player must use the rm command. However, the system is so corrupted that the player cannot delete junk files individually—they must delete entire "Personal Directories" (e.g., rm -rf /1998/SUMMER_CAMP) to wipe the associated background processes.

The Realization: By the end, the player understands that "stability" is synonymous with "blankness." To stop the terminal from flickering and crashing, they must delete everything—childhood, first love, and names of friends—until the prompt is just a blinking cursor in an empty root directory.

5. Technical Specification
Display: A simple 2D window simulating a monochromatic CRT terminal (Green or Amber on Black). Text-based, using a monospaced font.

Input: Standard keyboard input. The player types commands and presses Enter.

Game State:

StrainLevel: A float (0.0 to 1.0). If it hits 1.0, the game "Crashes" (ends in a static screen).

FileSystem: A nested dictionary representing folders and files.

ActiveProcesses: A list of "Memory Leaks" that increment the StrainLevel every second.

Assets Needed: None (all text and ASCII-based). Optional: A subtle "hum" or "static" audio file that increases in volume with StrainLevel.

Optimization: Since it is text-only, it will run on any laptop using a simple HTML5/JS canvas or a Python Curses/Tkinter window.

6. Implementation Pseudo Code
Python

# INITIALIZATION
Directory = {
    "ROOT": {
        "1995_CHILDHOOD": ["birthday_cake.mem", "swing_set.mem", "fear_of_dark.log"],
        "2010_ROMANCE": ["first_kiss.mem", "breakup_letter.txt", "the_rain_stop.mem"],
        "2023_PRESENT": ["office_keycard.bin", "exhaustion.log", "doctors_appointment.txt"]
    }
}
SystemStrain = 0.2
CurrentPath = "ROOT"
GameActive = True

# MAIN LOOP (Runs every 100ms)
while GameActive:
    # 1. Update System State
    LeakRate = len(All_Active_Files_In_System()) * 0.005
    SystemStrain += LeakRate
    
    # 2. Visual Feedback
    RenderTerminalUI(SystemStrain) # More strain = more text jitter/flicker
    
    if SystemStrain >= 1.0:
        EndGame("SYSTEM_HALTED: Identity lost.")
        
    # 3. Input Handling
    Command = GetInput() # e.g., "rm -rf 1995_CHILDHOOD"
    
    if Command.StartsWith("ls"):
        DisplayFiles(Directory[CurrentPath])
        
    elif Command.StartsWith("cd"):
        NewPath = Command.Split(" ")[1]
        if NewPath in Directory: CurrentPath = NewPath
        
    elif Command.StartsWith("rm"):
        Target = Command.Split(" ")[1]
        # Critical Narrative Logic: 
        # Deleting a folder reduces SystemStrain significantly 
        # but removes lines of story/text from the game world permanently.
        DeleteFromDirectory(Target)
        SystemStrain -= 0.3 # Instant relief for the "Brain"
        Print("Sector Purged. Pressure Dropping...")

    # 4. Progression Narrative
    if Directory == Empty:
        EndGame("SUCCESS: The mind is stable. The mind is empty.")
