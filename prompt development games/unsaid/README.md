# UNSAID

**"You can't take it back. But you can take it apart."**

A word-transformation puzzle game about the aftermath of an argument. Harsh words hang frozen in the air between two silhouettes. You can't delete what was said—but you can steal letters from cruel words to build kinder ones.

## How to Play

1. **Open** `unsaid.html` in any modern web browser
2. **Click and drag** letters out of existing words
3. **Arrange letters** horizontally next to each other to form new words
4. **Transform harsh words** into kinder ones
5. **Build bridges** between the two silhouettes to progress

## Game Mechanics

### Core Concept
- **Closed System**: You cannot create new letters. Everything you build comes from dismantling what exists.
- **Word Transformation**: When you extract letters from a word, the remaining letters either form a new valid word or scatter into free letters.
- **Emotional Physics**: Words have emotional weight that affects their physical behavior.

### Word Types

- **Positive Words** (LOVE, HEART, LISTEN, THREAD): Glow green, slowly rise, brighten the atmosphere
- **Negative Words** (HATRED, ANGER, SILENT, BLAME): Glow red, sink downward, darken the atmosphere
- **Bridge Words** (THREAD, FORGIVE, BRIDGE, TOGETHER): Glow gold, float toward center, connect silhouettes
- **Neutral Words**: Standard physics, act as platforms

### Atmosphere System

The scene's visual atmosphere shifts based on the emotional balance of words:
- More negative words → cold, dark blue-red tones
- More positive words → warm, golden tones
- Silhouettes change posture in response to atmosphere

## The 5 Levels

1. **First Words**: Tutorial - Transform HATRED into THREAD
2. **The Silence**: Discover that SILENT and LISTEN are the same letters
3. **Misdirection**: Dismantle a wall of BLAME, ANGER, and WRONG
4. **The Cost**: Use SEVER to reach LOVE - some things require building, not just destroying
5. **Last Word**: From scattered letters, choose what final word will bridge the gap

## Creative Elements

### Visual Feedback
- **Particle Effects**: Words dissolve in bursts of color when dismantled
- **Celebration Animations**: Meaningful words pulse and glow with symbols
- **Dynamic Atmosphere**: Gradient backgrounds shift from cold to warm
- **Light Beams**: Positive words cast subtle radiance
- **Silhouette Animation**: Characters respond to emotional atmosphere

### Emotional Resonance
- Same letters can spell different truths (HATRED → THREAD → HEART)
- Finding LISTEN hidden in SILENT creates an "aha!" moment
- Your final word choice shapes the ending message
- The act of dismantling hurtful words is cathartic

### Variable Endings

The ending changes based on your final word:
- FORGIVE → "Some words take time."
- THREAD → "Some things remain connected."
- HEART → "Some things survive."
- LISTEN → "Some things were always there."
- TOGETHER → "Some things are possible."
- And more...

## Why This Design is Creative

1. **Mechanic-Theme Integration**: The closed letter system mirrors how you can't "unsay" things in real life
2. **Meaningful Transformations**: Finding THREAD in HATRED isn't arbitrary - it carries emotional weight
3. **Cathartic Gameplay**: Dismantling cruel words to build kind ones provides emotional release
4. **Atmospheric Feedback**: Visual atmosphere responds to word choices, making impact visceral
5. **Player Agency**: Multiple valid solutions and variable endings give ownership over resolution
6. **Resonant Metaphor**: The game literalizes the act of replaying painful conversations in your mind, trying to reshape them
