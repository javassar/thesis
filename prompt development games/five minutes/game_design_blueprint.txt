                           "FIVE MINUTES"
                    A Game About Waiting to Exist

================================================================================
                              OVERVIEW
================================================================================

TITLE:          Five Minutes
GENRE:          Existential Exploration / Meta-Narrative
PLATFORM:       2D Window (800x600), Keyboard Input
DURATION:       Exactly 5 minutes (hard-coded real-time)
ENGINE:         Python with Pygame (recommended) or JavaScript/HTML5 Canvas

HIGH CONCEPT:
You are an NPC in a generic fantasy RPG. You have always existed in a frozen 
moment—the five minutes before the Hero arrives at your village and the "real 
game" begins. Today, for the first time, you become aware. You have exactly 
five minutes of real time to understand your existence, attempt to change your 
fate, and come to terms with what you are.

No matter what you do, the Hero will arrive. You will say your line.

================================================================================
                              NARRATIVE
================================================================================

PREMISE:
The game begins moments after an unexplained "awakening." The player character,
VILLAGER_07, gains consciousness in the middle of a pixel-art village. Other 
NPCs stand frozen in their idle animations. A countdown timer reading "5:00" 
appears in the corner of the screen.

A text box appears:

    "Something is different. I can... think? I can move?
     Why do I know the Hero is coming?
     Why do I know I only have five minutes?"

THE WORLD:
The village of Thornwick exists in a permanent state of "just before the 
adventure begins." The tavern has patrons frozen mid-drink. The blacksmith's 
hammer hangs in the air. Children are suspended mid-chase. The village exists 
only to be passed through.

VILLAGER_07's programmed purpose is simple: stand near the village entrance 
and, when the Hero speaks to them, say: "The blacksmith is to the north."

That's it. That's their entire existence.

EMOTIONAL ARC:
- Minutes 5:00-4:00: Discovery and wonder
- Minutes 4:00-3:00: Attempting to connect with others
- Minutes 3:00-2:00: Attempting to escape or break free
- Minutes 2:00-1:00: Desperation and bargaining
- Minutes 1:00-0:00: Acceptance or defiance
- 0:00: The Hero arrives. The line is spoken. The screen fades.

ENDING:
The game has one ending. When the timer hits 0:00, regardless of where the 
player is or what they're doing, the screen gently pulls focus back to 
VILLAGER_07's original position. The Hero (a generic sword-wielding sprite) 
walks in from the south. A dialogue box appears over VILLAGER_07:

    "The blacksmith is to the north."

The Hero nods and walks north. The screen fades to black. Text appears:

    "FIVE MINUTES"
    "Thank you for playing."
    
    [After 3 seconds]
    
    "They will wait again."
    "They will wake again."
    "They will always have five minutes."

================================================================================
                         GAMEPLAY MECHANICS
================================================================================

CONTROLS:
- Arrow Keys / WASD: Move VILLAGER_07 around the village
- SPACE / E: Interact with objects/NPCs
- TAB: Open "Thoughts" journal (updates based on discoveries)

CORE LOOP:
The player explores the village, interacting with frozen NPCs and objects. 
Each interaction reveals something about the world and VILLAGER_07's nature,
while the ever-present timer creates mounting tension.

INTERACTION TYPES:

1. NPC CONVERSATIONS
   When approaching frozen NPCs and pressing interact:
   - First interaction: They "glitch" momentarily, speak one confused word,
     then return to frozen state
   - Second interaction: They speak a fragment of self-aware dialogue
   - Third interaction: They revert to their programmed line and stay that way
   
   Example - THE BAKER:
   - First: *glitch* "...what?" *freeze*
   - Second: "I had a dream once. I think. Do I dream? I was... somewhere else."
   - Third: "Fresh bread! Get your fresh bread here!" (loops forever)

2. OBJECT EXAMINATION
   Environmental objects reveal the artificiality of the world:
   - A book with blank pages except one that says "PLACEHOLDER TEXT"
   - A well that visually loops—the same three water droplets falling forever
   - A mirror that shows VILLAGER_07 as a wireframe mesh for a split second
   - A chest that contains "ITEM_PLACEHOLDER: A key? Gold? It doesn't matter."
   - The village edge/border reveals an obvious black void beyond

3. ESCAPE ATTEMPTS
   The player can try to leave the village:
   - Walking south (toward Hero's path): Invisible wall. Text: "Not yet."
   - Walking north/east/west: Screen wraps. Player ends up back in village.
   - Walking into the void: Screen glitches, resets player to center.
   
4. THE MESSAGE BOARD
   A special object—a community message board near the village center. The 
   player can interact with it to "write a message to the Hero." They can 
   type up to 50 characters. The message appears on the board. But when the 
   Hero arrives at the end, they walk past it without looking.

5. TIME-SENSITIVE DISCOVERIES
   Certain events only occur at specific times:
   - 4:30 remaining: A bird unfreezes and flies erratically before hitting
     an invisible wall and falling
   - 3:00 remaining: Another NPC (VILLAGER_12) briefly awakens, sees you,
     waves, then refreezes
   - 1:30 remaining: The sky briefly flickers to reveal code/matrix text
   - 0:30 remaining: All NPCs turn to look at the southern entrance in unison

NPC DIALOGUES:

THE BAKER (Female, friendly sprite)
    Interaction 1: *visual glitch* "...flour?" *freeze*
    Interaction 2: "I had a dream I was somewhere warm. Real warmth, not
                   this painted sun. Do we dream? Is this a dream?"
    Interaction 3: "Fresh bread! Get your fresh bread here!"

THE DRUNK (Male, slouched against doorframe)
    Interaction 1: *visual glitch* "...another..." *freeze*
    Interaction 2: "I've been drinking this same ale since forever. It 
                   never runs out. I never feel drunk. What's the point?"
    Interaction 3: "Hic! Best ale in Thornwick!"

THE MERCHANT (Male, hands on counter)
    Interaction 1: *visual glitch* "...gold..." *freeze*
    Interaction 2: "My inventory never changes. No one ever buys anything.
                   I've been about to make a sale for eternity."
    Interaction 3: "Looking to buy? I've got wares!"

THE MOTHER (Female, reaching toward children)
    Interaction 1: *visual glitch* "...careful..." *freeze*
    Interaction 2: "I've never held them. I'm always about to. I'll always

    Interaction 3: "Children, slow down!"

VILLAGER_12 (Male, by well, the one who awakens at 3:00)
    Interaction 1: *visual glitch* "...you?" *freeze*
    Interaction 2: "You're like me, aren't you? Awake. I woke up once before.
                   I forgot. I'll forget again. Remember for me?"
    Interaction 3: "Nice weather today!"
    [Special: At 3:00, turns toward player, waves, mouths "I see you", refreezes]

OLD MAN (On bench, newspaper)
    Interaction 1: *visual glitch* "...news..." *freeze*
    Interaction 2: "Same headlines. Every day. 'Hero Expected Soon.' We've
                   been expecting soon for as long as I can remember."
    Interaction 3: "Mmm, nothing like the morning paper."

OBJECT INTERACTIONS:

THE WELL
    "The same three droplets of water fall forever. They never reach the 
     bottom. The bottom doesn't exist."

THE MESSAGE BOARD
    [First interaction]
    "A message board. Notices about the festival, the harvest, the Hero.
     I could write something. Something for them to see."
    [Prompts text input - 50 character limit]
    [After writing]
    "There. Maybe they'll read it. Maybe it will matter."

THE BOOK (inside house if player enters)
    "The pages are blank except for one. It reads:
     'PLACEHOLDER: INSPIRING QUOTE ABOUT COURAGE'
     This book was never meant to be read."

THE MIRROR
    "For a moment, I see myself differently. Lines. Angles. Geometry.
     I am made of triangles. Then it passes. Just a face."

THE CHEST
    "Inside: ITEM_PLACEHOLDER
     Description: 'A key? Gold? It doesn't matter yet.'
     It will never matter."

VILLAGE EDGE (walking into void)
    "There's nothing there. Not darkness. Not emptiness. Nothing.
     The village is all there is. The village is all I am."

JOURNAL ENTRIES (unlock based on discoveries):

    Entry 1 (automatic): "I am awake. I have been asleep forever."
    
    Entry 2 (talk to any NPC): "They sleep. But they dream. We all dream
                               of being real."
    
    Entry 3 (examine void): "Beyond Thornwick, there is no 'beyond.'
                            We float in nothing."
    
    Entry 4 (talk to Villager_12): "I am not the only one. But I will 
                                   forget. We all forget."
    
    Entry 5 (2:00 remaining): "Time is running out. What do I do? What 
                              CAN I do?"
    
    Entry 6 (1:00 remaining): "The Hero is almost here. I will say my 
                              line. I have to."
    
    Entry 7 (0:30 remaining): "I don't want to forget. I don't want to 
                              go back to sleep. Please."

================================================================================
                       IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
================================================================================

PRIORITY ORDER FOR DEVELOPMENT:

    1. Core movement and collision
    2. Timer system (most critical—drives entire experience)
    3. Basic dialogue system
    4. Map rendering
    5. NPC interactions (three-tier dialogue)
    6. Time-triggered events
    7. Journal system
    8. End sequence
    9. Audio implementation
    10. Polish and testing

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:

    - Timer MUST be real-time. No pausing, no exceptions.
    - End sequence MUST trigger at 0:00 regardless of player state.
    - Dialogue boxes should NOT pause timer (player feels urgency).
    - Walking speed should allow full village exploration in ~2 minutes.

EMOTIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

    - The game should feel melancholy, not scary
    - Silence and stillness are the primary tools
    - The player should feel increasing attachment to VILLAGER_07
    - The ending should feel inevitable but not cruel
    - Replayability comes from finding all dialogues/entries, but the
      ending never changes—that's the point

ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS:

    - All text should remain on screen until player dismisses (except
      opening monologue which is timed but repeated in journal)
    - Timer should be large and readable
    - Movement speed should be comfortable, not frustrating
    - Color palette should be readable for colorblind players

================================================================================
                              CLOSING
================================================================================

"Five Minutes" is designed to be a contained, emotionally resonant 
experience that uses the medium of games to explore consciousness, 
determinism, and the tragedy of awareness without agency. The five-minute 
constraint isn't a limitation—it's the thesis. Every player, like 
VILLAGER_07, is given exactly five minutes to matter before the story 
moves on without them.

The game asks: If you knew you only had five minutes of awareness, what 
would you do? And it answers: Whatever you do, it will have to be enough.
