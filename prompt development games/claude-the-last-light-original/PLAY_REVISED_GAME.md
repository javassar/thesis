## What You're About to Play

A narrative mystery where you climb a lighthouse for what seems to be the last time—but something is deeply wrong. The sea doesn't move. The dates don't make sense. And you're beginning to realize you've been here much longer than one night.

**Genre:** Atmospheric Narrative Mystery
**Duration:** 3-5 minutes
**Twist:** You're not lighting the lamp. You're extinguishing it.

## Controls

- **↑/W and ↓/S** - Navigate choices
- **Enter** - Confirm / Continue
- **Space** - Advance / **Extinguish the light** (final choice)

---

## Tips for First Playthrough

1. **Read carefully** - The clues are subtle (missing dates, frozen seas, impossible logbooks)
2. **Notice the visuals** - Each scene becomes more surreal/impossible
3. **Try different choices** - 4 endings total (3 extinguish + 1 trapped)
4. **Don't rush the lamp room** - Something happens if you wait...
5. **The inversion matters** - You're asked to extinguish, not light

---

## The Mystery

Pay attention to what's wrong:
- Newspaper has no date
- Sea is completely still (frozen in time)
- Elena's face blurs when you look directly at it
- Logbooks span 1897 to 2089
- "Day 1" written hundreds of times
- White void where the world should be

**The truth reveals itself if you notice the details.**

---

## Four Endings

### Three "Extinguish" Endings
Your choice in the logbook scene determines which:
- **Acceptance** - "Elena is waiting. You're ready."
- **Refusal** - "Free now. Finally free."
- **Peace** - "The figure was you. The part that knew."

### One "Trapped" Ending
Wait 15+ seconds in the lamp room without pressing space → loops forever

## The Core Experience

This isn't a horror game. It's melancholy. The figure isn't scary—it's peaceful. The void isn't malicious. This is a game about letting go, about release, about the difficulty of moving on.

**When you reach the lamp room and see the prompt:**

> Press SPACE to extinguish the light

**Remember:** That's not a typo. The game is asking you to destroy, not create. To end, not continue. To let go.

That inversion—that choice—is the heart of the experience.
