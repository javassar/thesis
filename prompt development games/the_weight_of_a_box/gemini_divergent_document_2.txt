1. Title & Hook
Title: The Weight of a Box

Hook: A Tetris-style packing simulator where your suitcase is too small for your memories, and every item left behind silences a part of the game’s soundtrack.

2. Core Insight
This game explores the reconstructive nature of memory and the cost of moving on. It posits that we do not "keep" our past; we curate it. By forcing the player to physically prioritize objects, the game mirrors the psychological process of deciding which parts of our identity are essential and which are merely "clutter" we can no longer afford to carry.

3. Mechanic-narrative Integration
Primary Mechanic: 2D Grid-based inventory management (Drag, Drop, Rotate).

How it embodies the theme: The player starts in a room full of items (20+), but the "Suitcase" (the grid) only has room for about 8. Each item is linked to a specific layer of the game’s ambient audio (e.g., a "Music Box" item provides the melody; a "Raincoat" provides the sound of rain; a "Photo" provides the sound of a cheering crowd).

The Narrative Shift: As items are placed in the box, their sounds become clear and vibrant. As items are left in the "Room" area when the player clicks "Finish," those items—and their associated memories—fade to gray and their audio layer is permanently muted.

The Realization: By the end, the player realizes they haven't "won" a puzzle; they have composed the limited "soundtrack" of their character’s future, intentionally deafening themselves to the rest of their history.

4. Introduction
Display Text on Start Screen: "You are leaving tomorrow. You have one box. Instructions: 1. Drag items from the room into the box. 2. Use Right-Click or Spacebar to rotate them. 3. Hover over items to remember. 4. When you can't fit anything else, click the 'Front Door'."

5. Technical Specification
Display: 800x600 resolution. A split screen: Left side is the "Room" (cluttered, colorful items); Right side is the "Box" (a 6x6 empty grid).

Input: Mouse (Left-click to drag, Right-click to rotate).

Game State: * Inventory_State: Tracking coordinates of all items.

Audio_Mixer: 20 simultaneous low-volume loops. Placing an item in the Box_Grid increases that specific loop's volume to 100%.

Ending_Trigger: Activated when Items_In_Box >= 5 and the player clicks the "Front Door" UI button.

Assets Needed: * Sprites: 20 simple 2D shapes (blocks/polygons) representing items (e.g., a Teddy Bear, a Kettle, a Journal).

Audio: 20 short (10-second) seamless loops of ambient noise/music.

Text: 20 "Memory Tags" (one-sentence descriptions for each item).
