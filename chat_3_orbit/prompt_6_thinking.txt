Worked for 4m 9s
I ran a mental playtest and tightened the Movement I clarity by adding an explicit chord objective plus chord progress dots in the HUD so the reset condition makes sense.

Playtest narrative (first-time casual player, thinking out loud):
I see the title screen. I skim the subtitle and click. Okay, starfield, a pulsing beat circle top-left, and a small launcher on the left. I drag from the launcher and release. A white probe shoots out, curves around the planet, and I hear a bell when it crosses a ring. Nice. The phrase bar at the top starts filling for a couple beats, but then it suddenly resets even though I’m still hitting rings. Huh? I try again, launch a second probe, hear more notes, and it still resets after four beats. I’m not sure what I’m missing. Am I supposed to hit specific rings in a specific order? There’s no visual hint, so I’m guessing and getting frustrated. I keep flinging probes and eventually stumble into a phrase that clears, but it feels like luck because I don’t know the requirement.

Confusion/issue flagged:

I don’t understand why the phrase bar resets in Movement I, even when I hit rings.
Playability issues and fixes:

Issue: Phrase resets feel arbitrary in Movement I.
Player view: “I’m hitting rings, but progress resets after four beats with no explanation.”
Root cause: Movement I uses motif: [null, null, null, null], and there was no UI showing the additional “hit C/E/G within the phrase” rule. index.html
Fix: Added an objective text line and chord progress dots that light as each required ring is hit. This makes the extra rule visible and explains the reset. index.html
Changes made:

index.html (objective text + chord dots in HUD for Movement I)
Testing:

Not run (mental simulation). Open index.html to verify the chord indicators resolve the confusion.
If you want, I can also playtest the revised HUD flow and report how it feels.
