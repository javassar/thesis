Findings

Medium: Audio can stay muted in browsers with autoplay restrictions because the AudioContext is only created/resumed when a sound is played during update, not on a user-gesture call stack. index.html (line 199)
Questions/Assumptions

Assumed audio should reliably start after the first user click/keypress; added a user-gesture unlock to ensure metronome and notes work.
Changes

Added pointer/keyboard input listeners to resume the audio context on first user gesture. index.html (line 199)
No other issues found in items 1–6.

Next step: Reload the page and confirm audio plays after the first click/keypress.
