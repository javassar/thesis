Let me review the current implementation to assess the player experience.

Read index.html
Let me think about the player experience from start to finish and assess creativity:

Title Screen: Simple but atmospheric - 4 pulsing orbs, title text, subtitle "Consume the music. Embrace the silence." This is decent.

Core Gameplay Loop: Move around, approach instruments, time feeds to the beat, avoid hazards. The concept of "sound is light" is genuinely creative - instruments illuminate the dark world, and silencing them makes it darker but safer.

What works well creatively:

The core concept - you're a creature of silence consuming music, and the world gets darker as you succeed

The "sound is light" metaphor is elegant

Each instrument has a unique hazard type

Beat-synced feeding mechanic

The tension of the world getting harder (remaining instruments get louder/brighter/more hazardous) but also quieter/darker

What falls short:

Visual monotony: The instruments are just colored circles. The player is a dark circle. Grid dots are generic. Everything feels like placeholder programmer art.
Instrument personality: Despite having unique hazard types, the instruments themselves feel interchangeable visually. They're just differently colored circles patrolling in patterns.
Lack of visual feedback: The game needs more polish in how it communicates what's happening to the player.
Atmosphere could be richer: The darkness is a solid black overlay with circular holes. No ambient particles, no atmospheric effects.
The feed mechanic visual is underwhelming: A white ring with pulse waves is functional but not evocative.
No visual storytelling: The game is supposed to be about a creature consuming music, but visually it's abstract circles.
Now I'm thinking about how to inject real personality into the visuals while keeping the mechanics solid. Each instrument needs its own distinct look that reflects its sound character—flowing lines for melody, heavy pulsing shapes for bass, layered rings for harmony, and sharp bursts for percussion.

I should make the grid respond to the beat patterns, with ripples emanating from each instrument when they play. Adding waveform-like particle effects around the instruments would reinforce the sound visualization, and I could show the "silence is your home" theme by revealing subtle ambient particles in the darkness as instruments get consumed. The player itself could visually absorb traits from what it eats, and atmospheric touches like flickering light edges and a shimmering boundary between light and dark would really sell the mood.

But I need to be realistic about complexity—I should focus on the changes that'll have the biggest visual impact without ballooning the code. I'm going to prioritize the most impactful visual improvements: beat-reactive instrument scaling so they pulse with their rhythm, floating particles that orbit each instrument to give them character, a fading trail behind the player, ghost particles that linger where instruments were consumed, and grid illumination that responds to nearby instruments—these changes will really strengthen the atmosphere and reinforce that core concept of sound as light.

Implementing these now.

The game's concept is genuinely creative — "sound is light, silence is darkness, you eat the music" is a strong metaphor. But the visual execution is extremely bare-bones: every game element is a plain colored circle, and the world feels static between beats. The atmosphere doesn't live up to the premise.

Here's what I'll improve without changing mechanics:

Beat-reactive instrument visuals — instruments pulse visually on their beats with unique styles
Floating ambient particles around living instruments (gives them life/personality)
Player movement trail — fading afterimages that make movement feel ethereal
Silence ghost particles — when an instrument dies, faint drifting ghost motes linger at the spot, a visual memory of consumed sound
Grid dots react to nearby instruments — glow with instrument color based on proximity, making light feel organic rather than just a circular mask
Let me implement these.

No syntax errors. Let me update the todo list and do a quick final review of the key new code sections:

Update Todos

Add beat-reactive instrument pulsing with unique styles per instrument

Add floating ambient particles around living instruments

Add player movement trail (fading afterimages)

Add silence ghost particles at consumed instrument locations

Add proximity-reactive grid dots that glow near instruments
All five enhancements are implemented. Here's what changed:

Beat-reactive instruments — Each instrument now pulses visually on beat with a style matching its character: Melody does quick bright flashes, Bass has a slow heavy throb on every other beat, Harmony gently swells every 4th beat, and Percussion does a sharp vertical snap.

Ambient motes — 6 small glowing particles orbit each living instrument, drifting and breathing in alpha. They make each creature feel alive and musical rather than a static colored circle.

Player trail — Moving leaves fading purple afterimages that shrink and vanish, making the Wisp feel ethereal and ghostlike.

Ghost motes — When an instrument is silenced, 12 faint particles spawn at its location and slowly drift upward, fading over 6-10 seconds. They serve as a haunting visual memory of consumed sound.

Reactive grid dots — Grid dots near living instruments glow with that instrument's color. As instruments are silenced, the grid gradually loses color and returns to dim white — the world literally becoming darker and less alive as you consume its music.
