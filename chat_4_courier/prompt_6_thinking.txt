Worked for 56s
I mentally play through the flow and hit a survivability issue in the first seconds, so I fixed it by adding a small permanent-dark “stoop shadow” around the start so new players can read and experiment without instantly overexposing.

Playtest Narrative
I see the title screen with the dial on the right. I read the short instructions and wiggle the dial; the shadows swing, cool. I click to start.
Okay, I’m a small white circle at the bottom-left. I tap WASD and start moving. The exposure bar at the top is already climbing fast. I don’t immediately see a safe spot nearby, and I haven’t learned what “in shadow” feels like yet. I’m about to hit failure in just a couple seconds.
Confused: Why am I getting exposed so quickly right out of the gate? I want a few seconds to understand the rules.
I restart, try sprinting and rotating the dial, but it still feels like I’m punished before I know where to go.

Issues & Fixes

Issue 1: Exposure starts climbing immediately at spawn, making the first 30 seconds feel unfair.
Player experience: I’m overexposing within ~2–3 seconds before I understand the rules.
Root cause: The start position is in the default lit area; exposure increases at +40/sec unless fully in shadow. updateExposure (index.html (line 666)) + start position (index.html (line 178)) + permanent dark zones do not cover the start (index.html (line 126)).
Fix: Added a small permanent-dark rectangle around the start so the player can learn safely. index.html (line 126)
No other frustration points surfaced in the mental run after that change.

Tests not run (manual playtest recommended).
