          this.tram.x += this.tram.speed * dt;
          this.tram.headlightRect.x = this.tram.x - 140;
          this.tram.headlightRect.x = this.tram.x - TRAM_HEADLIGHT_OFFSET - this.tram.headlightRect.width;
          this.tram.headlightRect.y = this.tram.y - 30;
Worked for 3m 6s
Adjusted the tram headlight placement to honor the 100px offset from the tram front; this keeps the headlight rectangle from overlapping the tram body and matches the spec. Changes are in index.html (line 65) and index.html (line 651).

Findings

Medium: Headlight rectangle was anchored directly at the tram’s front (offset 0), conflicting with the 100px offset requirement and making the light overlap the tram. Fixed by applying TRAM_HEADLIGHT_OFFSET in index.html (line 651) (constant defined at index.html (line 65)).
Tests not run.

Next steps (optional)

Open index.html in a browser and confirm the headlight spacing during the tram pass.
