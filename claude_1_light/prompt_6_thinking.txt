Let me read the full game code to do a thorough mental playtest.

Let me mentally simulate playing through this game as a first-time casual player.

Title Screen
I open the game. Dark screen. I see a small dark moth shape bobbing gently. A golden beam sweeps across from left to right. When it passes the moth, particles burst out, the moth transforms to golden wings, and "Last Light" fades in. "Click to begin" pulses below. Nice intro.

I click. Screen fades out.

Level 1
"Level 1" appears in gold, fades in and out. Then the game loads.

I see a warm orange-to-dark gradient background. There's a half-sun on the left edge shooting a horizontal golden beam.

Now I'm tracing where that beam actually travels across the level—checking which platforms and obstacles it would intersect with based on the geometry. I need to work through the collision physics more carefully. The moth sprite uses a centered origin, so when it's positioned at (100, 490), that's the center point. With the physics body sized at 24x28 with a (4,2) offset, I need to figure out where the actual collision bounds are relative to the sprite position and how it will interact with the platform collider.

For the floor platform centered at (480, 592) with size (960, 96), the top surface is at y=544. When the moth is standing on it, the bottom of the moth's collision body needs to align with that surface, which means the sprite should be positioned at y=530.

Now I'm getting a sense of the game from a player's perspective—there's the moth starting on the left side of the screen, a horizontal golden light beam, platforms above, and a gray diamond shape higher up. The controls hint confirms arrow keys or WASD for movement. When I test the controls, the moth moves right at 220 pixels per second and can jump about 90 pixels high. As I explore, I notice a small floating object with spinning golden dots around it near the middle of the screen, and there's a faint diagonal line visible somewhere.

The anchor point at (400, 400) has those spinning dots and a "/" indicator, though I don't immediately understand what it's for. A shadow wall starts creeping in from the left after a few seconds, moving at 12 pixels per second—slow enough that it'll take about 80 seconds to cross the entire screen, which feels very forgiving for the first level.

When I walk closer to the spinning object, a hint pops up telling me to press SPACE near the anchor to perch. I do, and the moth teleports to that position and settles into a light form with pulse rings appearing around it. Now I'm positioned at the anchor where the golden beam is also passing through at that same height, so the beam would hit me if I'm perched there.

Let me trace through the collision: the beam originates at (24, 400) moving right, and my perched hitbox is a 32-pixel square centered at (400, 400). The beam's path intersects the left edge of my hitbox at x=384, which is 360 pixels from the beam's starting point. When it hits, the "/" deflection rule kicks in—the beam bounces upward instead of continuing right. From that collision point, the beam travels straight up toward the crystal at (400, 100).

The crystal's hitbox spans from x=384 to x=416 and y=84 to y=116. Since my upward-traveling beam is at x=384, it falls right on the crystal's left edge and will strike its bottom surface at y=116, adding another 284 pixels to the total distance.

So the beam path is: travels right, hits the perched moth at (384, 400), deflects upward, and strikes the crystal at (384, 116) to complete the level. This happens instantly when the player perches on the anchor, making it a straightforward tutorial. The hint prompts them to press SPACE near the anchor to perch, which triggers the beam redirection. There's an interesting mechanic here too—when they un-perch, they leave behind an echo that also deflects the beam, so either the active player or the echo can solve the puzzle.

Now I'm checking whether the player can actually reach the anchor at (400, 400). Starting from the floor at y≈530, they'd need to jump 130 pixels straight up, but their max jump is only 90 pixels. However, there are platforms to climb: one at y=480 gets them within 64 pixels of the next platform at y=416, and from there it's another 64-pixel jump to reach the anchor. Both jumps are achievable.

From the second platform spanning x=360 to x=460, the player can position themselves near x=400 and be just 10 pixels away from the anchor, close enough to perch by pressing SPACE.

Now I'm moving into Level 2, which introduces a faster light decay and more complex geometry. The sun beam travels horizontally at y=450 toward a crystal positioned much higher up at (800, 170), with two "/" anchors placed at different heights along x=320. There's a ladder structure on the left side with platforms at decreasing y-values that the player will need to navigate.

The core mechanic here is that the player must first reach the lower anchor to redirect the beam upward, then leave an echo there to maintain that deflection while climbing higher to the second anchor where the final redirect happens. B → beam going up hits B, deflects right → goes right at y=170 → hits crystal at (800, 170)

Wait, the beam hits the echo at A first. Echo at (320, 450), hitbox (306, 436, 28, 28). Beam going right at y=450 hits at x=306, y=450. Deflection "/" → (0, -1), beam goes up from (306, 450).

Then the player needs to be perched at B (320, 170) or have an echo there. If perched at B: hitbox (304, 154, 32, 32). Beam going up from x=306 hits the bottom of B's hitbox at y=186. Deflection "/" → beam goes right from (306, 186).

The crystal at (800, 170) has its hitbox at y range [154, 186], so the beam traveling right at y=186 hits the bottom edge and completes the level. But the echo at A only lasts 8 seconds, so I need to figure out the timing and platform positions to see if this solution is actually feasible. to climb to the anchors. I perch on the first one, the beam goes up. I jump off — oh, it says "Your echo lingers..." — my ghost stays behind and keeps deflecting! I need to climb up to the second anchor before my echo fades. I see the timer bar above the echo. I climb fast. I reach the top anchor, perch, and the beam goes right to the crystal. Done!

Actually, the player doesn't need to stay perched at the second anchor — they just need to perch there momentarily while the first echo is still active, and the beam will pass through both anchors and hit the crystal. This is a solid introduction to how the echo mechanic works.

For level 3, I'm setting up the geometry: the sun's beam travels horizontally at y=300, the crystal sits higher up at (880, 120), and a shadow moves across the screen in about 32 seconds. There's a dark zone blocking the middle path, forcing the player to navigate around it. Two anchors are positioned vertically on the right side, and a ladder climbs up the right edge with several rungs. The player starts on the left floor and needs to figure out how to use shadow form to cross the dark patch in the middle.

Now I'm working through the physics of crossing that gap. The dark zone creates a 200-pixel gap between the left and right floors. In shadow form with higher speed, the player can jump across it—the math checks out for about 230 pixels of horizontal distance during a jump. But there's a catch with the light form that I need to think through. light form (speed 220): 220 * 0.95 = 209px. Also crossable but tighter.

The player has to jump the gap. In light form, they'd enter the dark zone and start the 1.5s death timer, but they're airborne crossing in about 0.86s (200/220 time, but they need to factor in the jump arc). Actually, they might survive the crossing even in light form since 200px / 220px/s ≈ 0.9s < 1.5s timer. But the dark zone is at y=300-544, and the player enters it when crossing at y≈530 level. The player is in the dark zone for the time it takes to cross horizontally. If they jump at x≈340 with velocity 220, they reach x=550 in about 0.95s. The dark zone timer is 1.5s, so they'd survive even in light form!

That somewhat undermines the shadow form mechanic for this level, but the hint tells them to use shadow form, and the narrative says "to cross the dark, you must become it." So the player is guided to use shadow form anyway.

After crossing, the player needs to climb the ladder on the right side to reach the anchors. Anchor A is at (600, 300) with a platform below it, so the moth can perch there. The beam travels right at y=300, hits the moth at anchor A, deflects upward, and needs to reach anchor B at (600, 120).

The beam goes up from around x=586, hits B's hitbox, deflects right, and travels to the crystal at (880, 120). But the player needs echoes here too—they perch at A to leave an echo, climb to B, perch there, and the beam bounces through both anchors to reach the crystal. It's the same pattern as level 2.

Now I'm checking the platform gaps between the anchors: they're all around 76 pixels except for the last couple which are 62 and 42 pixels. All manageable.

The real concern is time pressure. With shadow form moving at 30px/s, crossing the dark zone takes about 32 seconds. The player needs to cross the gap, climb 6 platforms, perch at A and leave an echo, climb 2 more platforms to B, and perch there. That's roughly 15-20 seconds total, which leaves some buffer but it's getting tight.

The echo at A only lasts 8 seconds, and climbing from A down to B is about 4 platform jumps at roughly 1.5 seconds each—so about 6 seconds. That's cutting it close, but doable if the player executes cleanly. It's the right difficulty for level 3, where a couple of failed attempts feel appropriate.

Now moving to level 4, which has the hint "Not every path leads where you need." The sun is positioned at (0, 350) with the beam traveling right along y=350, and the crystal is at...

Looking at the anchor setup: there are three anchors total, but the trick is that anchor C is a red herring. If the player uses C with its backslash reflection, the beam gets deflected downward into a dead end. The correct solution requires using anchors A and B in sequence—first the forward slash at A to bounce the beam upward, then the forward slash at B to redirect it right toward the crystal at (800, 150). There's also a platform ladder on the left side and an extra platform positioned to help with navigation. Player experience: "I see three anchors. One on the right side at (550, 350) is on a separate platform. The other two are stacked vertically at x=300. I try the right one first... beam goes down. Dead end. I restart. Now I use the left anchors — same pattern as before, echo at A, climb to B."

The right anchor at C is actually a trap — if the player skips A and perches directly at C, the beam travels right past A (with no echo there to deflect it) and hits C instead, sending it downward into a dead end. So C only works as a solution if A is already set up first. The platform at (510, 366) gives access to C, while the lower platform at (260, 366) would let the player jump toward it.

Now looking at Level 5: the sun's at the left edge, beam travels horizontally at y=400, and the crystal sits far right. I've got four anchors to work with — two "/" and "\" mirrors at different heights, plus a prism in the middle. The shadow moves at 45 pixels per second, giving about 21 seconds before it crosses the screen.

The beam starts moving right, hits the first mirror and deflects upward toward the prism. When it reaches the prism, it splits based on the incoming direction — a vertical beam splits into left and right paths, while a horizontal beam splits into up and down. So the upward beam hitting the prism should split into two new beams going sideways.

The left beam shoots off-screen, which doesn't help illuminate the dark zone since it's traveling at y=200 while the dark zone sits much lower at y=300-544. The right beam continues rightward, hits another mirror at (600,200), deflects downward, and then hits a third mirror at (600,400) where it deflects again.

Following the full beam path, I need to place echoes at four locations: the starting point A, the prism P, and mirrors B and C. That's four anchors total, which matches the maximum echo limit, but the player would need to perch at each one sequentially and leave an echo before moving to the next—a tight sequence given the 8-second timer per echo.

Actually, the beam only needs to hit either a perched player or an echo at each anchor point to deflect properly. So I don't need echoes at all four locations—I could place echoes at three of them and just stay perched at the final one. Let me map out the fastest route from the starting floor level.

Looking at the platform layout, I can reach anchor A by climbing up through the platforms and positioning myself at x=300 on the platform at y=416. The anchor sits at (300, 400), which is only 2 pixels below where the player would be standing—well within the 33-pixel reach threshold. So anchor A is definitely reachable.

Now I'm mapping out the full sequence: climb to A around 4 seconds in, place an echo, then continue climbing through the lower platforms to reach P at (300, 200) by around 10 seconds. The echo at A will fade after 8 seconds from placement, so it should still be visible when I reach P.

For the jump to B at (600, 200), I need to trace the path across the right-side platforms—jumping from my current position through the intermediate platforms and checking if I can actually reach the anchor point given the player's collision bounds.

But I'm running into a timing issue: Echo A fades at 12 seconds, I leave it at 10 seconds to jump to B, and by the time I reach B around 13 seconds, Echo A is already gone. I can't maintain all four echoes this way.

Let me reconsider the approach—maybe going top-down instead of this order would work better, or I need to recheck how the echo timer actually works and whether I'm calculating the fade times correctly. you re-perch on the same anchor, it refreshes the echo timer.

The key insight might be that the player doesn't need ALL four deflectors active simultaneously. Let me re-trace the beam:

The beam goes right → A → up → P → splits left+right. Left beam illuminates. Right beam → B → down → C → right → crystal.

For the crystal to be reached, the beam needs to pass through A, P, B, C in sequence. All must be active simultaneously.

With 8s echo timers and 4 required stops, this seems nearly impossible unless the player is extremely fast. That's a real playability problem.

Actually wait, let me re-check. Could the player be perched at C (the last one) and have echoes at A, B, and the prism? They'd need to echo A, then P, then B, then perch at C—all within 8 seconds. That's an incredibly tight window given the traversal time between each point.

Let me map out the actual path: starting from the floor, I'd jump to A around 3 seconds in, leave an echo, then work my way up through the intermediate platforms to reach P, then down to B, and finally to C. The question is whether I can complete this sequence before the first echo at A expires. I'm realizing the core issue: Echo A fades after 8 seconds, but I need it to persist long enough to set up all four deflection points simultaneously. Maybe the puzzle doesn't require all anchors to have active echoes—perhaps the player can position themselves at A while maintaining echoes at P, B, and C instead.

Let me trace through a viable sequence: climb to P and leave an echo there, jump over to B and place another echo, drop down to C for the third echo, then make the run back to A to perch. The timing works out—Echo P gets placed around 6 seconds and won't fade until 14 seconds, giving me a comfortable window to complete the remaining steps before everything needs to be in place. s, echo C at ~12s, echo P at ~6s. So P fades at 14s, B at 17s, and C at 20s. If I perch at A around 16s, P has already faded—that won't work. This level might actually be unsolvable with the current timing. Let me recalculate the echo duration based on the alpha decay formula—it looks like echoes are only active for about 7 seconds, which makes the window even tighter.

Actually, let me step back. Do I really need all four deflectors active simultaneously? The level description says the right beam goes through B then C to reach the crystal, while the left beam illuminates a dark zone. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. What if I try a different sequence: hit A first from the bottom of the left ladder, then move to C at the bottom right, then B at the top right, and finally perch at P? Starting with a jump to A around 3 seconds in...

Then I'd leave the echo there and run right to reach C. Unperching from A, falling to the floor, running across to the right side, and climbing up to the platform where I can perch at C takes roughly 3.7 seconds from when I placed the A echo. From there, I need to climb up through multiple platforms to reach B at the top, which adds another 5.2 seconds or so. But that puts me at nearly 9 seconds since I placed the A echo, and the echo would've already faded by then. I'm running into the same timing problem again.

The core issue is that the echo timer is too short for the amount of setup required. I'm wondering if I should reconsider the approach entirely—maybe there's a way to set up the echoes more efficiently, or perhaps the puzzle expects me to work with a different configuration of perches. Let me think about whether I could place echoes at multiple locations while the player stays perched at A, then return to A afterward. That would require getting P, B, and C set up within the 8-second window before coming back, but the traversal distances make that seem nearly impossible with the current timing.

Actually, let me trace through what might be the intended optimal path: starting from A, I'd jump up through the intermediate platforms toward P, placing an echo there around the 5-second mark, then continue right toward B, reaching it just before the timer expires at around 7.4 seconds. The margin is razor-thin, which suggests either the puzzle is designed to be extremely tight, or I'm missing a more efficient route.

The real constraint is that all four deflection points need to be active simultaneously for the beam to reach the crystal—A deflects up, P splits the beam, B deflects down, and C deflects right. Since each echo lasts only 8 seconds and they're spread across the level, I need to place them in rapid succession, which means the path between them has to be nearly optimal. , all 4 need to be simultaneous. With 8s timers and these distances, I think this level is practically unsolvable for most players.

Actually, wait — I just realized: can the player perch at C (staying perched) while echoes at A, P, B are active? The player places echoes at A, P, B and then perches at C. Echo at A just needs to survive until the player reaches C.

The issue is just the timing. Let me try to minimize the path:

Start at (100, ~530). Run right to x=260 area. Jump up 2 platforms to (260,416). Perch at A (300,400). Un-perch. Time: ~3s. Echo A starts.
Jump up 3 platforms: (260,340), (260,264), (260,216). Each jump is ~0.75s. Time: ~2.25s. Perch at P (300,200). Un-perch. Time from A echo: ~5.25s. Echo P starts.
Now I need to get to B at (600,200). Jump right from (300,200) to platform (400,264), then to (560,216), and perch at B. Time from A echo: ~6.85s. Echo B starts.
Drop down to C (600,400) from B, falling through the platforms below. Perch at C to stay in position while all three echoes are active.
The problem is that echo A fades out around 7.1 seconds when its alpha drops below functional levels, but reaching C takes about 8.85 seconds total. The level is unplayable with current parameters — I need to either extend the echo duration to 12 seconds or restructure the anchor placement to be much closer together. Option 1 seems like the least disruptive fix.

Now looking at level 6, the sun creates a rightward beam at y=200 that hits anchor A in the dark zone on the left side of the screen. The beam deflects downward through B, then back right through C and D to eventually reach the crystal.

The challenge is that both A and B sit inside the dark zone where the player can't normally see or interact, so they'll need to venture into that shadowed area to position themselves on those deflection points.

Now I'm checking the echo mechanics more carefully. Echoes only spawn when the player leaves a perch while in light form, but the dark zone is lethal to light form unless they're actively perched. So there's a tension here—they need to be in light form to create echoes, but light form kills them in the dark zone unless they're already anchored to something.

Checking the damage logic... The timing works out—switching forms, perching, and unperching all happen instantly, so the player has plenty of room within the 1.5-second death window. But this is a complex sequence that demands real understanding of the mechanics, which might overwhelm someone experiencing it for the first time. The narrative hint should guide them through it, though I'm wondering if it's clear enough.

Now I'm mapping out the level layout and checking if the four simultaneous anchors are actually reachable. Looking at the platform positions on both sides and the gaps between them—they're all manageable distances, under 90 pixels each. From the starting position, the player can climb the right ladder and work their way up to reach the anchor at the top.

But I need to reconsider the anchor positions. C and D are both on the right side, while A and B are in the dark zone on the left. So the better approach is to start by perching at C near the floor level, which puts me close enough to the platform below to make the first move efficiently.

From C, I can climb the right ladder up to D, which takes about 4.5 seconds and leaves an echo there. Then I drop down, cross the floor to the left side, switch to shadow form, and climb the left ladder to B. By the time I reach B and set up the echo there, C's echo has already faded—it only lasts 7-8 seconds, but I need closer to 11 seconds to complete the sequence. The timing still doesn't work out.

Levels 5 and 6 both hit the same wall: the 4-deflector puzzles demand too much movement time for the 8-second echo window.

Now I'm looking at Level 7, which introduces a completely different mechanic. The sun casts a beam across the screen, and there's a shadow moving at a fixed speed that takes about 15 seconds to cross. The level has four anchors arranged in a grid pattern, and the key twist is that anchors are linked—when I perch on one anchor, it activates a different anchor. I'm working through the code that handles this linking behavior.

The shadow moth mechanic means the shadow mirrors my position. When I perch on the anchor at (600, 320) in light form, the shadow simultaneously "perches" at (240, 320), activating that anchor as a beam deflector. The beam needs to bounce through a specific sequence: it comes in from the left, hits the first deflector and bounces up, then hits the second deflector and bounces right, then hits the third deflector to reach the crystal.

But I'm realizing there's a problem with the geometry. If the beam is traveling down from (600, 120) and the crystal is at (900, 320), the beam won't actually reach it since they're on different x-coordinates. Let me trace through the intended path more carefully to see where the deflection sequence breaks down. Now I'm working through the actual route the player needs to take. They need echoes at anchors 2 and 3 while also being perched at anchor 1 to deflect the beam, with shadow anchor 0 activating automatically. Starting from the spawn point, I'm tracing a path up the left side platforms to reach anchor 2, checking that all the vertical gaps between platforms are climbable.

Once at anchor 2, the player perches and leaves an echo, then needs to jump right toward anchor 3. I'm calculating whether they can make the jump from anchor 2 down to the middle platform at (380, 260) — it's a significant distance both horizontally and vertically, so I'm checking if this is actually feasible or if there's a better route.

Now I'm working through the path to anchor 3 at (600, 120). The player would land on platforms at x=560 and climb up, then perch at anchor 3. From there, they need to descend to anchor 1 at (600, 320), but I'm running into the same distance problem — standing on the platform at (560, 336), the moth at y=322 is still about 40 pixels away from anchor 1, which exceeds the perch range.

Wait, I'm recalculating the geometry. The platform at (560, 336) has a width of 80 pixels, so it spans x=560 to x=640. At x=600, the distance to anchor 1 at (600, 320) is only 2 pixels vertically — that's well within range. So the moth can perch there.

Now I'm timing out the sequence. If the echo was placed at anchor 2 around t=0, then the journey down to the middle platform takes about 1.5 seconds, jumping to the right platforms and climbing up another 1.5 seconds or so, then dropping to anchor 1. That's roughly 8-10 seconds total, and I'm worried the echo might fade before the moth gets back to it.

Let me trace through more carefully. From the middle platform at (380, 260), there's a platform at (560, 184) that overlaps horizontally even though there's a vertical gap of 76 pixels — totally jumpable. Then another 48-pixel jump up to (560, 136). So that's about 2 seconds of climbing, placing the echo at anchor 3 around t=3.5 seconds. From there, dropping straight down lands on platforms at y=184, 260, and 336.

Now I'm working through the descent. The moth falls through those platforms, each drop taking roughly half a second to a second, so three drops total about 2 seconds. That puts the perch at anchor 1 around t=6 seconds. Echo 2 was placed at the start and lasts about 7.1 seconds, so at t=6 it's still active with time to spare. The beam fires, all deflectors are in position, the crystal gets hit, and the level completes. It's tight timing but achievable with efficient play.

Now I'm checking the shadow mechanics — it moves at speed 65 and takes about 15 seconds to cross the screen, but there's a 3-second delay before it starts moving.  So it reaches the left side where anchor 2 sits at x=240 around t=6.7 seconds. The player needs to place their echo at anchor 2 before the shadow consumes it, because when an anchor gets consumed, any echoes linked to that anchor are destroyed too.

Checking the destruction logic...

Destroying echoes when anchors are consumed...

The player's timing is tight—they need to reach anchor 2, place their echo, and move on before the shadow wall catches up at around 6.3 seconds into the level.

But here's the problem: the shadow consumes anchor 2 at 6.7 seconds, which destroys any echo left there. The player would need to complete the entire puzzle sequence (echo 2 → echo 3 → perch 1) in less than 0.4 seconds after placing the echo, which is physically impossible. The echo can't outlive its anchor once it's consumed, so level 7 appears to be unsolvable as currently designed. So the player reaches anchor 2 around 6.07 seconds, places an echo, but the shadow destroys it at 6.7 seconds—giving them only 0.63 seconds to continue, which isn't enough to solve the puzzle. Level 7 is fundamentally broken as it stands.

Let me think about an alternative approach: what if the player prioritizes the right side first where it's safer longer? They could go to anchor 3 on the right, place an echo there, then move to anchor 2 on the left, place another echo, and finally drop to anchor 1.

Working through the timing: starting from the spawn point, they run right and climb to anchor 3 in about 5 seconds, leaving an echo. Then they jump to the middle platform and across to the left side, climbing up to anchor 2—that takes roughly 3 more seconds. By the time they're at anchor 2 around 8 seconds total, the shadow is already closing in based on its spawn time and movement speed.

Actually, let me recalculate: the shadow spawns at 3 seconds and moves at 65 pixels per second. After 5 seconds of active movement, it's at position 325, which means it's already passed anchor 2's x-coordinate of 240. The player can't perch on a consumed anchor, so this route doesn't work. They'd need to reach anchor 2 and leave before the shadow gets there around 6.7 seconds, which means going left immediately instead of right first to save time.

But the echo gets destroyed as soon as the shadow arrives, so that won't help solve the puzzle. The real issue is that the left-side anchors are being consumed before they can be used. Unless the shadow anchor itself at position 240,320 is meant to be accessed directly through the shadow mechanic without needing an echo—let me check how that's supposed to work. Anchor 2 at (240,120) gets consumed by the shadow, destroying any echo left there, so the beam traveling straight up from (240,320) has nothing to deflect it rightward—it just shoots off screen. This makes Level 5 unsolvable as currently designed, since the four deflection points can't all be active simultaneously. end. The beam needs to be redirected right to reach the crystal. The only way is via anchor 2 or 3.

What if anchor 2 could be replaced by the player's perched position somewhere? No, the player is perched at anchor 1. They can't be in two places.

What about using the echo system differently? Could the player perch on anchor 2, leave an echo, and then the echo survives even after the anchor is consumed? No, the code explicitly destroys echoes when their anchor is consumed.

So level 7 is genuinely broken. For levels 5 and 6, I need to increase echo duration from 8 seconds to around 14 seconds or more to give players enough time to set up all the deflectors. For level 7, the anchor consumption mechanic itself is the blocker—I'd need to either redesign the puzzle or change how anchors interact with echoes.

The cleanest approach is to increase the echo timer to 14 seconds across the board, which solves levels 5 and 6, and then modify the echo destruction logic so echoes persist even when their anchor is consumed. This would let level 7 work as intended without requiring major spatial adjustments.

But I'm second-guessing myself—destroying echoes on anchor consumption is a core mechanic that creates meaningful tension. So instead, for level 7 specifically, I should adjust one of the shadow parameters. Let me work through the math: if I reduce the shadow speed to 25 pixels per second, the shadow reaches x=240 around 12.6 seconds, giving the player enough time to set up the echo at anchor 2 before the shadow destroys it.

The problem is that even with this buffer, the echo only survives about 4.6 seconds after being placed, and the player needs roughly 5 seconds to navigate from anchor 2 down to anchor 1. The timing is still too tight, which means the real issue is that echoes disappearing on anchor consumption fundamentally conflicts with the level's design.

I'm considering an alternative: what if echoes persisted even after their anchor point gets consumed by the shadow wall? It would make thematic sense—the echo as a lingering remnant of light that outlasts its source. But that might undermine the shadow wall's threat level across all levels, since part of its tension comes from eliminating your resources.

For level 7 specifically, a more targeted fix might be repositioning the anchors further right to give the player more time and space to work with.

Actually, I'm noticing something in the code—the shadow anchor at (240,320) stays active even when consumed because it's checked independently of the isConsumed flag. What if anchor 2 worked the same way? Looking at the level design path, anchor 2 at (240,120) could function as a shadow anchor too, especially since the shadow moth mirrors the player's position. When the player reaches anchor 1, the geometry might naturally resolve.

But that's adding new mechanics. For the simplest fix, I should increase the echo timer from 8 to 14 seconds to give levels 5 and 6 more breathing room, and slow the shadow speed in level 7 from 65 to 20 so the player has roughly 15 seconds before it reaches anchor 2—enough time to set up the echo chain at anchors 2 and 3 before the shadow arrives.

Actually, slowing the shadow that much might make level 7 feel too easy. Let me think about repositioning the anchors instead—moving anchor 2 and its shadow counterpart anchor 0 further right to x=400 would change the timing. If the shadow moth mirrors the player's position, I can calculate when it reaches that new position and see if the math works out better than just slowing it down. anchor position in the code is fixed:


const sa = this.anchorObjects[0]; // fixed at (240,320)
The shadow anchor IS anchor 0, positioned at a fixed location. The shadow moth visual appears at a mirrored position, but the beam deflection uses anchor 0's fixed position. So moving anchor 0 would change where the beam deflects.

If anchors 0 and 2 are at x=400: beam goes right at y=320 → shadow anchor 0 (400,320) "/" → up → anchor 2 (400,120) "/" → right → anchor 3 (600,120) "\" → down → anchor 1 (600,320) "\" → right → crystal (900,320).

Shadow reaches x=400 at t = 3 + 400/65 ≈ 9.2s. Player needs to echo anchor 2 before then, so from the starting position I'd need to run left and climb up to reach it in time. Since anchor 2 would be much closer now, that's actually feasible.

But I'm realizing the anchors need platforms positioned near them for this to work. Let me reconsider the whole level 7 layout with anchors at x=400 and x=600. Actually, let me check the original level 7 first to see if I'm missing something obvious.

Wait, I'm noticing something about the shadow moth calculation in the drawing code... the shadow delay longer for level 7. Instead of 3 seconds, give a 12-second delay. Shadow at speed 65 reaches x=240 at 12 + 240/65 ≈ 15.7s. With 14s echo timer, the player has ~15.7s to place echo at anchor 2 and complete the puzzle. If they reach anchor 2 at ~8s, place echo, echo lasts until ~22s (14s timer), but echo is destroyed at 15.7s when anchor is consumed. So echo survives for ~7.7s, which gives the player enough time to work with the deflected beam before losing it.

Now I'm mapping out the exact path: from anchor 2 at (240,120), the player needs to reach anchor 3 at (600,120) and then anchor 1 at (600,320) within that 7.7-second window. The route involves jumping down and right to the middle platform, then up to anchor 3, placing the echo there, and finally dropping down to anchor 1 to complete the sequence.

The shadow reaches x=600 around 21.2 seconds, so the echo placed at anchor 3 will persist well past when the player needs it at anchor 1 around 14.5 seconds. This timing works out, but I need to adjust two things: increase the echo timer from 8 to 14 seconds, and extend the shadow delay beyond the standard 3 seconds for this level since the current hardcoded delay is too short.

I'm exploring different approaches—slowing the shadow speed to 20 pixels per second gives a 7-second window for the echo, but that makes level 7 easier than earlier levels, which doesn't fit the difficulty curve. Instead, I could increase the shadow delay to 10 seconds while keeping the speed at 65, which would push the shadow reaching x=240 to around 13.7 seconds.

My best solution is to adjust the echo timer from 14 to 12 seconds for more urgency, vary shadow delays across levels, and specifically give level 7 an 8-second delay. Now I'm checking whether levels 5 and 6 work with this 12-second echo timer—level 5 needs to go A→P→B→C with the echo placed at 3 seconds, requiring the full route to complete by 15 seconds.

For level 6, the route C→D→shadow form→B→A with an echo at 1.5 seconds needs completion by 13.5 seconds, but the player doesn't reach A until 14 seconds, so 12 seconds is cutting it too close. I'm reconsidering whether 14 seconds might be necessary after all.

Actually, I'm overthinking the precision here. With 14-second echoes, the buffer becomes manageable for levels 5-6. But I'm also realizing I need to update the echo bar display, which currently assumes an 8-second timer. I could either adjust the timer globally or redesign levels 5-7 to work with the existing 8-second duration, though changing the timer seems like the simpler approach overall.

Let me reconsider the numbers: if I set the echo timer to 12 seconds and update the bar accordingly, level 5 works fine with a 7.85-second gap, but level 6 still fails with a 12.5-second gap. Bumping it to 14 seconds solves level 6, or I could explore alternative routes for level 6 that work within 12 seconds—like having the player switch to shadow form first and navigate through the dark zone differently.

For this alternate route, the player would run left to the dark zone, switch to light form to anchor at platform B and trigger an echo, then switch back to shadow. From there, they'd climb up through the dark zone to anchor A over about 6 seconds, trigger another echo, then exit right and switch back to light form around the 8.5-second mark.

Continuing with the right side: climbing to anchor D takes another 4 seconds, putting them at 12.5 seconds total. The echo at D triggers while echo B from the 2-second mark is still active (10.5 seconds of life remaining), but by the time they drop down to C at 16.5 seconds, echo B has already faded at the 14-second mark. This timing is still too tight, so I'm reconsidering the sequence as B→A→C→D instead, placing echoes at B and A on the left side first, then moving to C on the right side around 9 seconds with another echo.

Checking the math on this new sequence: echo B placed at 2 seconds fades at 14 seconds, echo A placed at 6 seconds fades at 18 seconds, echo C placed at 9 seconds fades at 21 seconds, and they perch at D around 13 seconds. At that 13-second mark, all three echoes are still active—B has 1 second left, A has 5 seconds, and C has 8 seconds—which means the beam fires with all four anchors active. This actually works! The level is solvable with the 12-second echo duration if the player executes this optimal path.

But that 1-second buffer on echo B is really tight. Most casual players won't stumble onto this exact sequence on their first try. With 14-second echoes instead, echo B would have a 3-second buffer before fading, making the puzzle much more forgiving and accessible.

I'm going to go with 14 seconds for the echo duration. Now I need to reconsider level 7 with this adjustment and see how the timing works out. The shadow spawns with a 3-second delay and moves at speed 65, reaching x=240 around 6.7 seconds. The player's optimal route is to run left immediately, climb to anchor 2, place an echo there, then head right. From the starting position, that climb takes roughly 6.3 seconds, so the echo gets placed right around when the shadow arrives at that critical x-coordinate.

That's way too close — only 0.4 seconds before the echo gets destroyed. I need to push the shadow back further. If I increase the shadow delay to 8 seconds, it reaches x=240 at about 11.7 seconds, giving the player 5.4 seconds after placing the echo to complete the rest of the level. But the remaining sequence from anchor 2 through anchor 3 and back to anchor 1 takes around 6.5 seconds, which overshoots that window.

Let me try a 10-second shadow delay instead. That puts the shadow at x=240 around 13.7 seconds, which gives more breathing room.

With a 10-second delay, the player gets a 7.4-second window after placing the echo at 6.3 seconds, and they only need 6.5 seconds to complete the sequence — that leaves a 0.9-second buffer, which actually works. I could also experiment with reducing the shadow speed instead, but that makes the final level feel sluggish. The real solution is making the shadow delay configurable per level, so I can set it to 10 seconds for level 7 while keeping the default 3 seconds for earlier levels. So the plan is to increase the echo timer from 8 seconds to 14 seconds globally, make the shadow delay configurable per level with a 3-second default and 10 seconds for level 7, then update the echo bar display and alpha calculations to use the new 14-second divisor instead of 8. I'm also checking whether this longer timer breaks the earlier levels—looks like levels 1 through 3 should all be fine since they don't rely on tight echo timing constraints.

The max echo count of 4 shouldn't become a problem either, since players naturally move past each echo point rather than stacking them up. Now I'm looking at other playability issues that came up during testing, particularly around level 3's dark zone and how the player navigates the floor gap.

The dark zone covers the gap between floors at x=350-550, and in light form the player has 1.5s before the death timer kicks in. Since the jump itself only takes about 0.9s, they can actually make it across without switching to shadow form at all. The hint suggests using SHIFT, but it's not mechanically necessary here—which creates a bit of confusion without breaking the level.

The real problem is that players might skip learning shadow form entirely if they cross in light form, only to hit a wall later in level 6 where it becomes essential. The narrative hint should guide them, but there's no hard requirement forcing them to learn the mechanic now. In shadow form, the beam damage timer is 1.0s, but the player crosses well below the beam anyway, so that's not an issue. I'm trying to figure out if there's a scenario where a player gets genuinely stuck without understanding why.

The bigger concern is that level 1 never explicitly tells the player to redirect the beam to the crystal—they just see the hint about perching near the anchor. If they randomly perch and the level completes, they might not understand the actual goal. If they never perch at all, they're left wandering without direction. This is a classic puzzle game discovery moment, but it could leave some players confused about what they're supposed to be doing.

There's also a critical gap with shadow form: the code only creates echoes in light form, but this constraint is never explained to the player. In level 6, when they need to enter the dark zone in shadow form but also need echoes to progress, they'll hit a wall without understanding why. And I'm checking what happens when the player touches the shadow wall itself...

Checking shadow collision logic... I'm settling on two critical fixes: bumping the echo timer from 8 to 14 seconds and giving level 7 a longer shadow delay of 10 seconds to prevent the wall from destroying anchor 2 before the puzzle resolves. I'll skip the hint since the game already guides players enough. Let me verify the shadow timing across the other levels — level 5 should be solvable now with the echo lasting until around 9.7 seconds when the shadow reaches the anchor.

Wait, I'm recalculating level 5's window more carefully. The player places the echo at anchor A around 3 seconds in, and the shadow wall destroys it at 9.7 seconds, giving only a 6.7-second window. But the full sequence from A to P to B to C takes 7.85 seconds, which exceeds that window — the echo gets destroyed before the player can complete the chain.

Now checking level 6: the shadow moves at speed 55 and reaches the dark zone anchors at x=150 around 5.7 seconds from the start. The player places echo B at roughly 2 seconds, but the shadow arrives and destroys it at 5.7 seconds, leaving only 3.7 seconds of usable time. The player hasn't even finished the puzzle by then.

This reveals the core issue: the shadow wall is destroying both anchors and their echoes before multi-step beam paths can be completed, especially for anchors on the left side. The cleanest solution is to decouple echoes from their anchors—once placed, an echo persists independently as a memory of light, even if the shadow consumes the physical anchor point.

This creates natural gameplay tension: the player races to place echoes at left-side anchors before the shadow arrives, knowing those echoes will linger for their full 14-second duration. Now I need to adjust the echo's alpha and glow calculations to work with the longer timer.

Adjusting echo rendering... Updating the echo timer from 8 seconds to 14 seconds across all the relevant places—when echoes are created, refreshed, and reset during the victory sequence. Now let me verify how these changes affect the difficulty progression, starting with level 5 where the shadow reaches the anchor at around 9.7 seconds.

Checking the player's path through the anchors and whether the echoes remain active long enough to protect them. The echo at anchor A lasts until 15.44 seconds, which covers the perch at 10.85 seconds, and the other echoes at P and B are similarly active throughout the sequence. The shadow's position at 10.85 seconds is about 353 pixels from the starting point.

Now verifying which anchors get consumed: A and P are both past the shadow's position, so their echoes activate and protect them. B hasn't been reached by the shadow yet, and C is safe since the player's already perched there. Level 5 checks out.

Moving to Level 6 with 14-second echoes and a faster shadow at speed 55. The shadow reaches the dark zone anchors at x=150 around 5.7 seconds, which means anchor A gets consumed when the player arrives there at 6 seconds—just barely too late.

I'm testing different routes: going to B first takes about 2.5 seconds, but then climbing to A afterward still puts the player at around 6 seconds total, missing the window. The direct route to A is tight at 5.5 seconds but might just work if executed perfectly. The core issue is that A's position and the shadow's speed create a very narrow margin for error. that's nearly impossible in 5.7s.

Alternative route: go to A first. From (400,490): run left to x=110 (290px at 242 shadow speed = 1.2s). Climb to (110,216) = 5 platforms from floor. Each gap: 544→496=48, 496→420=76, 420→344=76, 344→268=76, 268→216=52. At ~0.8s per jump = 4s. At (110,216), switch to light, perch A (150,200). Total: 1.2 + 4 + 0.5 = 5.7s.

Shadow arrives at x=150 at 5.7s. It's a race! The player might make it with perfect execution but a casual player won't.

For level 6, I need to adjust the shadow mechanics. Let me test per-level delays: levels 1-4 stay at 3s, level 5 gets 5s so the shadow reaches x=300 at 11.7s with plenty of buffer, and level 6 gets 5s delay too, meaning the shadow hits x=150 at 7.7s. That gives the player about 7.7 seconds to run left, climb to A, place an echo, drop to B, and place another echo—the route takes 7.2s total, leaving just a 0.5s margin.

Increasing level 6's delay to 6s gives the shadow arrival at 9.7s, which is much more forgiving with a 4.5s buffer. Level 7 gets 8s delay, putting the shadow at x=240 around 11.7s. I want the game to be challenging but not require pixel-perfect timing, so I'm settling on these delays: 3s for levels 1-4, 5s for level 5, 6s for level 6, and 8s for level 7. Let me double-check level 6 with the 6s delay to see where the shadow actually arrives. 8.7s.
Player reaching A at ~5.7s (shadow form run + climb). Echo A at 5.7s. ✓
Player reaching B at ~7.7s. Echo B at 7.7s. 8.7 > 7.7. ✓ (1s buffer)
Then run right, climb to C (~11s), echo C.
Then climb to D (~15s), perch.
Echo A at 5.7s, functional until 5.7+12.44=18.1s. At t=15: alive. ✓
Echo B at 7.7s, functional until 20.1s. ✓
Echo C at 11s, functional until 23.4s. ✓

Level 6 works with 6s delay. ✓

Level 7 with 8s delay: Shadow reaches x=240 in 11.7s. Player runs left to anchor 2 in 1.3s, climbs 6 platforms in 4.8s, placing echo at 6.1s—survives until 18.5s. Then jumps right to anchor 3 in 3s, drops to anchor 1 in another 3s, perching around 12.1s.

At t=12.1, echo 2 is still active (until 18.5s), echo 3 is active (until 21.5s), and the shadow is perched at anchor 1. All four deflection points are live and the crystal gets hit. Level 7 works.

Now I'm thinking about a couple of design issues. The player might not immediately understand the goal in level 1, but the hint about pressing SPACE near anchors to perch gives enough guidance—when they perch, the beam redirects and the crystal lights up, teaching the mechanic through direct feedback. I don't think I need an explicit goal hint.

The other issue is that the beam only redirects when the player is actually perched on an anchor, not just standing nearby. The player might assume walking on the anchor platform is enough, but...

Actually, the perch mechanic should make this clear. Let me verify the crystal hitbox alignment across the levels to make sure the beam paths actually connect. In level 1, the beam travels upward from (384, 400) and the crystal sits at (384, 84) with a 32x32 hitbox, so the beam hits the crystal's bottom edge at y=116. I need to be more careful about the exact collision point though—the beam hits the moth's hitbox when perched, and that hitbox is centered on the moth's position with a 32x32 size, so with the moth at (400, 400), the hitbox spans from (384, 384) to (416, 416).

Now checking the deflection: the beam comes in from the right at y=400, hits the moth's left edge at x=384, and bounces upward. The crystal is at (400, 100) with hitbox (384, 84, 32, 32). Since the beam is traveling straight up at x=384, I'm checking if that x-coordinate falls within the crystal's horizontal range [384, 416]—it does, right on the left edge. Working through the ray-box intersection math with the vertical direction, the beam enters at t=284 and exits at t=316, confirming the collision happens.

The key insight is that this works because both the moth and crystal are anchored at x=400, so their hitbox left edges align perfectly at x=384. The integer coordinates prevent floating-point errors from breaking the collision detection.

Now for level 2: the echo at (320, 450) gets hit by the beam and deflects it upward. The moth perched at (320, 170) is then in the beam's path, and I'm calculating the intersection—the beam hits the moth's top edge at y=186 after traveling 264 units upward from the echo.

From there, the deflected beam travels right and reaches the crystal at (800, 170), hitting its left edge at x=784. The beam path checks out, so now I need to implement the actual fixes: extending the echo timer from 8 to 14 seconds across all references and making sure echoes persist even after anchor consumption.

I should also verify the shadow timing for earlier levels—Level 3's shadow takes 35 seconds total to cross the screen with a 3-second delay, and Level 4's shadow reaches anchor A in about 11 seconds, both giving the player enough time. Now I'm ready to start coding these changes, though I'm also wondering about the random number generation approach for the shadow delays.

I'll read through and mentally simulate the full experience now. Let me trace the game logic carefully.

Playtest Narration
Title Screen: "I see a dark screen with a small dark moth shape. A golden beam sweeps across horizontally. When it passes the moth, particles burst out, the moth transforms golden, and 'Last Light' appears. 'Click to begin' pulses. Nice. I click."

Level 1: "I see a warm orange gradient. A golden beam shoots horizontally from a half-sun on the left. 'Arrow Keys / WASD to Move' is on screen. I see my golden moth on the left near the floor, some small platforms, a spinning golden dot cluster with a faint '/' line, and a gray diamond shape up high."

"I jump up to the first platform (y=480, gap=64px), then the second (y=416, gap=64px). The spinning dots are right here. Text says 'Press SPACE near anchor to perch.' I press SPACE. Rings pulse out! The beam redirects upward and hits the diamond — it explodes with golden light! Level complete. Cool!"

Level 2: "'The light fades faster than you remember.' Two anchors stacked vertically, platforms going up. I perch on the lower anchor, beam goes up. I press SPACE to leave — oh, 'Your echo lingers...' — a ghost of me stays behind deflecting the beam! I see a timer bar above it. I climb fast to the upper anchor, perch. Beam goes up through my echo, then right through me to the crystal. Done!"

Level 3: "'To cross the dark, you must become it.' There's a black patch in the middle with a gap in the floor. Hint says 'press SHIFT to enter shadow form.' I press SHIFT — my moth turns dark and small. I jump across the dark gap (200px, within my jump range). I switch back to light on the other side, climb the ladder, echo the lower anchor, climb to the upper one, perch. Done."

Level 4: "'Not every path leads where you need.' Three anchors — two on the left stacked, one on the right with a '\'. I try the right one first... beam goes down into the floor. Dead end! I go back to the left pair — same echo+climb pattern. The red herring adds a nice puzzle moment."

Level 5: "'Light bends. Light splits. Light finds a way.' Four anchors including a prism. I need A→Prism→B→C. I perch on A, leave echo. Climb to prism, leave echo. Jump right to B, leave echo. Drop down to C, perch..."

WAIT. I trace the timing:

Echo A placed at ~3s, fading over 8s (functional for ~7.1s, until ~10.1s)
I reach C at ~10.85s from start
Echo A has already faded!
And worse — shadow speed 45 consumes anchor A (x=300) at t ≈ 3 + 300/45 = 9.7s. Echo A is destroyed by the shadow wall at 9.7s. Even if the timer were longer, the shadow kills the echo.

"I die because the shadow caught up. I restart. I try going faster but the echo at A keeps fading or getting consumed before I can finish setting up all 4 deflection points. I try every route order. Nothing works. I'm stuck."

Level 6: Same 4-deflector problem, compounded by dark zone anchors at x=150. Shadow reaches x=150 at t ≈ 5.7s. Even rushing there in shadow form, I can barely place one echo before the anchors are consumed. Unsolvable.

Level 7: Shadow wall at speed 65 reaches anchor 2 (x=240) at t ≈ 6.7s. Even if I sprint left immediately and climb perfectly, I barely reach it in time — and the echo is immediately destroyed when the anchor is consumed. Unsolvable.

Summary of fixes
Three critical playability issues were found and fixed:

Echo timer 8s → 14s — The 8-second echo duration made levels 5, 6, and 7 practically unsolvable. With 4 deflection points spread across the map, players couldn't set up all echoes before the first one faded. Extended to 14s, giving players ~12.4s of functional echo time.

Echoes survive anchor consumption — When the shadow wall consumed an anchor, all echoes at that anchor were destroyed. This made left-side echoes impossible to maintain in later levels. Now echoes persist independently — a "memory of light" that outlives its source. The anchor becomes unusable for new perches, but existing echoes continue deflecting.

Per-level shadow delay — The 3-second shadow delay was insufficient for complex multi-anchor puzzles. Added shadowDelay to level data: Level 5 gets 5s, Level 6 gets 6s, Level 7 gets 8s. Earlier levels keep the default 3s.
