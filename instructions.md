# Coding Agent Instructions

You are a coding agent tasked with implementing the game described in `game-design-document.md`.

## Task
Implement a playable version of the game as specified in `game-design-document.md`.

## Agency
- You may choose programming language, engine, libraries, and architecture unless explicitly specified in `game-design-document.md`.
- You may interpret underspecified details in reasonable ways consistent with the design intent.
- You should complete the task end-to-end without human intervention.

## Constraints
- Do not change the game concept, mechanics, or goals described in `game-design-document.md`.
- Do not add features not implied by the design document.
- Do not optimize for production quality beyond what is necessary for a working prototype.

## Output
- Produce a runnable game.
- Include brief instructions for running the game.
- Prefer simplicity over polish unless the design document demands otherwise.

## Stopping Condition
Stop once the game is playable according to the design document.
