I will begin the playtest simulation now.

  Playtest Narrative

  "Okay, the game loaded. 'The Static Between Us.' The instructions say to use WASD and Arrow keys and keep the signal stable. I see the two characters,
  the white one and the blue one, connected by a wavy line. There's a 'Signal Health' meter at 100. Let's go."

  "I press the arrow keys, the blue character on the right moves. I press WASD, the white one on the left moves. I can control both at once. Interesting.
  I need to get up those platforms."

  "I jump the white character up to the first ledge on the left. Easy. Now I jump the blue character to the first ledge on the right. Done. The line
  between them is stretching and it turned yellow. The health number is ticking down. Okay, so that's the 'stability' part. I'll move them a bit closer
  to each other on their ledges. The line turns cyan again and the health starts to go back up. I get it."

  "Now for the next jump, to the higher platforms. I'll jump the white one first. I press 'W' and 'D' to get him up there. He lands. Now, I need to jump
  the blue one up to his platform. I'm holding 'D' to keep the white one from falling off... now I need to press the 'Up' arrow to jump blue... [FLAG]
  Wait, as soon as I let go of 'D' to get my hand ready for the blue character's jump, the white character just stopped dead and fell off the platform.
  Ugh. The level restarted. That feels a bit clumsy. It's hard to juggle holding a key for one character while pressing a key for the other."

  "Let me try again. White character up. This time I'll just quickly tap him onto the platform and hope he's stable. Okay, he's there. Now I jump blue...
  he makes it. Phew. Health is dropping fast because they're far apart, the line is red and the screen is gray. I need to hurry."

  "Now they're both on the higher platforms. There's a small platform in the middle, right below the green goal box. They have to come together. I'll
  jump the white one on there... okay. Now the blue one... [FLAG] Whoa, red flashes everywhere! My health is draining like crazy! They're both on the
  platform but because it's so small, they're too close and the game is penalizing me for it. I'm trying to jump them both into the goal but they keep
  bumping and the health is almost gone. This feels unfair. I'm being punished for following the path."

  "I manage to jump both into the goal just before my health hits zero. The screen fades to white... 'I'm here.' That's a cool ending, but getting there
  was frustrating."

  Playability Issues & Fixes

  Based on the playtest, I've identified two primary playability issues that create an unfair experience for a new player.

  1. Issue: Instant-Stop Movement
   * Player Perspective: "When I let go of a movement key, my character stops instantly. If they are on the edge of a platform, they fall immediately.
     This makes it hard to switch between controlling two characters, as one can fall off while I'm repositioning my hands to control the other."
   * Root Cause: The player sprites have no physics drag. The code sets their velocity to 0 the instant a key is released (this.p1.setVelocityX(0);).
   * Fix: I will apply a drag value to the player sprites. This will cause them to slide to a stop over a very short distance, giving the player a moment
     of grace and making the controls feel smoother and more forgiving.

  2. Issue: The "Too-Close" Platform Trap
   * Player Perspective: "The game tells me not to get too close, but the final platform before the goal is so small that it forces my characters to be
     too close, causing me to lose health rapidly. It feels like a trap I can't avoid."
   * Root Cause: The final platform's width forces the characters into a proximity smaller than the nearThreshold (60 pixels), triggering the penalty.
     The level design is in direct conflict with the game rules.
   * Fix: I will slightly increase the width of the final central platform. Increasing it from 100 to 120 pixels will provide just enough space for both
     players to stand on it without triggering the "too close" penalty, removing the point of frustration while keeping the challenge of bringing them
     together.

  I will now apply these two fixes to the code.

✦ I have addressed the playability issues identified during the playtest. The character movement is now more forgiving due to the addition of physics
  drag, and the final platform has been widened to prevent the frustrating "too-close" trap. The game should now play smoothly and fairly from start to
  finish.
