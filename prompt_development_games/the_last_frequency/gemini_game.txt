TITLE: The Last Frequency
GENRE: Narrative Thriller / Micro-Puzzle
PLATFORM: Laptop (Browser or Desktop)
CONTROLS: Arrow Keys (Left/Right), Spacebar (Interact)
ESTIMATED PLAYTIME: 5 Minutes (Scripted pacing)

1. CORE CONCEPT
---
The player takes the role of a lone radio operator in a sub-arctic research station during a total blackout. They must tune a radio to receive a critical distress signal, only to realize the signal is coming from "inside" the station.

---
2. VISUAL & AUDIO STYLE
---
- VISUALS: Low-fidelity, monochromatic green "radar" aesthetic. 2D side-on view of a cluttered desk. 
- LIGHTING: The screen is dark. The only light comes from the glowing dials of the radio and a small flashlight beam controlled by the player's cursor or movement.
- AUDIO: Heavy focus on diegetic sound. Wind howling outside, static noise, the mechanical "clack" of switches, and a heartbeat monitor that speeds up as the game progresses.

3. GAMEPLAY LOOP (5-MINUTE BREAKDOWN)
---
[0:00 - 1:00] THE SETUP: 
- Player starts in darkness. Text on screen: "Signal lost. Recalibrate."
- Goal: Use Arrow Keys to move the radio frequency dial (visualized as a moving line on a wave graph).
- Task: Match the player's sine wave to a "Ghost Wave." 

[1:00 - 2:30] THE NARRATIVE HOOK:
- Once matched, audio plays: A distorted voice reading coordinates.
- Dialogue Box (Bottom): "That's the SOS... but those coordinates are here. This room."
- The "Ghost Wave" begins to glitch. Red hues bleed into the green screen.

[2:30 - 4:00] THE ESCALATION:
- The player must "lock" three sub-frequencies. Each time a lock is successful, a loud "thump" sounds from the game's left or right audio channel (simulating a knock on the station door).
- Difficulty: The frequency dial becomes "slippery," requiring more precise Arrow Key taps.

[4:00 - 4:45] THE REVEAL:
- The final signal clears. The audio isn't a voice—it's the player's own breathing, delayed by 5 seconds.
- Text: "The signal is coming from 0.0 meters away."

[4:45 - 5:00] THE ENDING:
- The screen flickers. A silhouette appears in the reflection of the "monitor" (static image overlay).
- Screen goes to black. Text: "Frequency Closed."

4. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR PROGRAMMER
---
A. INPUT HANDLING:
- Map 'Left' and 'Right' arrows to the 'Current_Frequency' variable (float 0.0 to 100.0).
- Spacebar triggers 'Confirm_Selection'.

B. THE WAVE MATCHING MECHANISM:
- Logic: If (Math.abs(Player_Freq - Target_Freq) < 0.5) for 2 continuous seconds, trigger 'Frequency_Lock'.
- Function: Render two Sine Waves. Wave A (Target) is static. Wave B (Player) changes amplitude/frequency based on input.

C. ASSET LIST:
- Background: 'Station_Desk.png' (Darkened).
- UI: 'Radio_Dial_Overlay.png'.
- Audio: 'Wind_Loop.mp3', 'Radio_Static.mp3', 'Voice_Log.mp3', 'Heartbeat.mp3'.

D. UI/UX:
- Use a typewriter effect for all text (50ms delay per character).
- Implement a 'Shake' function on the camera for when the "thumps" occur.

5. PROGRAMMER NOTES
---
- Do not add a 'Restart' or 'Menu' button until the 5 minutes have elapsed. 
- The game must run in a fixed 16:9 aspect ratio.
- The pacing of the "Ghost Wave" movements should be hard-coded to ensure the game ends exactly at the 5-minute mark.
