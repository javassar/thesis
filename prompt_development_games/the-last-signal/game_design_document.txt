                              SECTION 1: CONCEPT
================================================================================

HIGH CONCEPT
------------
You are a radio operator at a remote Arctic research station in December 1962.
A garbled distress signal breaks through the static. As you tune frequencies
and decode transmissions, you realize the voice on the other end knows things
about you—things no stranger should know. The signal is coming from yourself,
three days in the future, warning you of a disaster you still have time to
prevent.

CORE EXPERIENCE
---------------
- Atmospheric tension and mystery
- Simple but satisfying radio-tuning mechanics
- Branching narrative based on player choices
- A twist ending that recontextualizes the entire experience
- Emotional resonance through minimalist storytelling

UNIQUE SELLING POINTS
---------------------
1. Time-loop narrative told through radio transmissions
2. Tactile "analog" interface design
3. Multiple endings based on trust and choices
4. Replay value through discovering hidden frequencies

================================================================================
                              SECTION 2: NARRATIVE
================================================================================

SETTING
-------
- Location: Station Vostok-7, a fictional Soviet-American joint research 
  outpost in the Arctic Circle
- Time: December 14, 1962, 11:47 PM
- Atmosphere: Howling wind, isolation, Cold War paranoia, the hum of 
  vacuum tubes

PROTAGONIST
-----------
- Name: Sam Reeves (gender-neutral, never shown)
- Role: Night-shift radio operator, alone at the station
- Backstory: Former Navy communications officer, haunted by a past failure
  to relay a distress call that cost lives

THE SIGNAL
----------
The transmission comes in fragments. The voice (also Sam, from 72 hours ahead)
is desperate, cryptic, and running out of time. Future-Sam speaks in short
bursts between waves of static.

NARRATIVE BEATS (5-minute structure)
------------------------------------

MINUTE 1: THE SIGNAL ARRIVES
- Player adjusts to the interface
- Static breaks into fragments of a voice
- First clear words: "...anyone... this is... please respond..."
- Player must tune the frequency dial to lock on

MINUTE 2: FIRST CONTACT
- Voice becomes clearer
- Future-Sam asks: "Is this December 14th? Before midnight?"
- Player can respond YES or IGNORE
- Future-Sam says: "Thank god. Listen carefully. You need to—" [static]

MINUTE 3: THE WARNING
- Player must decode a Morse code burst (simple pattern)
- Message: "GENERATOR FUEL LINE COMPROMISED"
- Future-Sam explains: There will be a fire. Everyone dies.
- Player choice: BELIEVE or DOUBT

MINUTE 4: THE PROOF
- If DOUBT: Future-Sam reveals something only Sam would know
  (The name of Sam's childhood dog, or the last thing Sam's father said)
- If BELIEVE: Future-Sam gives instructions for preventing the disaster
- Either path: Future-Sam's signal begins to fade
- Critical choice: GO CHECK THE GENERATOR or KEEP LISTENING

MINUTE 5: THE ENDING
- ENDING A (Go Check): Player leaves the radio. Screen shows the walk to the
  generator room. You find the compromised fuel line. Fix it. Survive. But
  the radio is silent when you return—you'll never know if you were the one
  who sent the signal.
  
- ENDING B (Keep Listening): Future-Sam's final words reveal that they made
  the same choice—stayed at the radio. "I didn't go. I didn't believe myself.
  Don't make my mistake." Signal dies. Player has 10 seconds to decide:
  finally go, or accept fate.
  
- ENDING C (Hidden): If player discovers the secret frequency (107.3) early
  in the game, they hear a SECOND signal—another voice, warning them not to
  trust the first transmission. This unlocks a conspiracy ending.

================================================================================
                              SECTION 3: GAMEPLAY
================================================================================

CORE MECHANICS
--------------

1. FREQUENCY TUNING
   - Visual: A large analog dial (0-150 MHz range)
   - Control: Left/Right arrow keys OR A/D keys for fine adjustment
   - Feedback: Static intensity changes as you approach signal
   - The "sweet spot" is narrow; requires precision
   - Audio: Static, warble, and clarity shifts

2. MORSE CODE DECODING
   - Visual: Dots and dashes appear on a paper tape readout
   - Mechanic: Player types the decoded letter using keyboard
   - Simple patterns only (S=..., O=---, etc.)
   - Wrong answers cause the message to repeat
   - Reference card shown on screen

3. DIALOGUE CHOICES
   - Visual: Text options appear on a "notepad" UI element
   - Control: Number keys (1, 2, 3) or click
   - Timing: Some choices have a 10-second timer
   - Consequences: Affect which information Future-Sam reveals

4. THE FINAL CHOICE
   - Visual: Two options dominate the screen
   - "LEAVE THE RADIO" vs "STAY AND LISTEN"
   - No time limit, but tension is high
   - This determines the primary ending

CONTROLS SUMMARY
----------------
- Arrow Keys / A,D: Tune frequency dial
- Spacebar: Transmit / Confirm
- Number Keys 1-3: Select dialogue options
- Letter Keys: Type Morse code answers
- Escape: Pause menu

DIFFICULTY & ACCESSIBILITY
--------------------------
- No fail states (wrong choices lead to different story paths, not game over)
- Morse code section has optional hint system
- Tuning has audio AND visual feedback for accessibility
- All text is displayed AND spoken (for hearing/visual accessibility options)

================================================================================
                              SECTION 4: ART DIRECTION
================================================================================

VISUAL STYLE
------------
- Aesthetic: 1960s military equipment meets analog horror
- Color Palette: 
  * Primary: Dark green (#1a2f1a), amber (#ffbf00), black
  * Accent: Red warning lights (#ff3333)
  * Background: Deep blue-black (#0a0a14)
- UI Style: Skeuomorphic analog equipment
  * Bakelite knobs and switches
  * Phosphor-glow text displays
  * Paper tape readouts
  * Flickering indicator lights

KEY VISUAL ELEMENTS
-------------------
1. THE RADIO CONSOLE (Center of screen)
   - Large frequency dial with illuminated numbers
   - VU meter showing signal strength
   - Morse code tape output slot
   - Transmission indicator light

2. THE ENVIRONMENT (Background, subtle)
   - Window showing blizzard outside
   - Occasional lightning flashes
   - Clock on wall showing real-time progression
   - Photos pinned to a corkboard (world-building)

3. THE NOTEPAD (Dialogue UI)
   - Appears as a physical notepad beside the radio
   - Player "choices" are handwritten-style text
   - Crossed-out options after selection

ANIMATION PRIORITIES
--------------------
- Frequency dial smooth rotation
- Static/snow effect on "screen" portions
- Flickering lights during electrical surges
- Paper tape feeding out during Morse sections
- Text appearing letter-by-letter for transmissions

================================================================================
                              SECTION 5: AUDIO DESIGN
================================================================================

MUSIC
-----
- No traditional soundtrack
- Ambient drone that shifts with tension
- Built from:
  * Low-frequency hum of equipment
  * Distant wind howling
  * Occasional creaks of the building
- During climactic moments: subtle heartbeat percussion

SOUND EFFECTS (Priority Order)
------------------------------
1. Radio static (multiple layers, reactive to tuning)
2. Voice transmissions (processed, degraded quality)
3. Dial clicks and mechanical sounds
4. Morse code beeps
5. Wind and environmental ambience
6. Warning buzzer (used sparingly for impact)
7. Clock ticking (subtle, increases during timed choices)

VOICE ACTING
------------
- Single voice actor needed for Future-Sam
- Direction: Exhausted, desperate, fighting to stay calm
- Processing: Add radio distortion, occasional breakup
- Approximately 2-3 minutes of recorded dialogue
- Alternative: High-quality text-to-speech with heavy processing

================================================================================

[Full script provided for implementation]

---SCENE 3: FIRST CONTACT---

FUTURE_SAM_01: "...hello? Is anyone there? Please... I need to know if this 
is getting through."

[PLAYER TUNES IN]

FUTURE_SAM_02: "Oh thank god. Thank god. Listen to me carefully—what's today's 
date? Is it still December 14th?"

CHOICE_1:
  [1] "Yes, it's the 14th. Who is this?"
  [2] "I'm not authorized to share that information."
  [3] [Stay silent]

[IF CHOICE 1]
FUTURE_SAM_03: "Before midnight? Please tell me it's before midnight."

[RESPONSE: AUTO]
PLAYER_RESPONSE: "It's 11:48 PM. Identify yourself."

FUTURE_SAM_04: "There's no time to explain properly. You need to check the 
generator room. The auxiliary fuel line—there's a crack. In three days, 
it's going to spark. Everyone is going to die."

[IF CHOICE 2]
FUTURE_SAM_03B: "It doesn't matter. Regulations don't matter. You need to 
listen to me. The generator room—"

[IF CHOICE 3]
FUTURE_SAM_03C: "I know you're there. I can hear you breathing. Please. 
This is life or death."

---SCENE 4: MORSE CODE---

FUTURE_SAM_05: "The signal's degrading. I'm going to send coordinates in 
Morse. Write this down."

[MORSE SEQUENCE PLAYS: ..-. .. .-. .]
[ANSWER: FIRE]

FUTURE_SAM_06: "Did you get it? Tell me you got it."

CHOICE_2:
  [1] "Fire. I got it. How do you know about this?"
  [2] "This is insane. Who put you up to this?"

---SCENE 5A: THE PROOF (if doubted)---

FUTURE_SAM_07A: "You want proof? Fine. Your dog when you were eight. 
Barnaby. Brown and white. Hit by a mail truck on your birthday."

FUTURE_SAM_08A: "The last thing your father said to you before you shipped 
out: 'Don't be a hero.' I know because I'm you, Sam. I'm you, three days 
from now, and I watched everyone burn because I didn't listen."

---SCENE 5B: THE INSTRUCTIONS (if believed)---

FUTURE_SAM_07B: "The fuel line is behind the secondary panel. You need a 
wrench—there's one in the utility closet. Tighten the coupling. That's all 
it takes."

FUTURE_SAM_08B: "The storm will knock out main power at 11:52. When the 
generator kicks in, if that line is still cracked... I can't watch it 
happen again."

---SCENE 5: THE CHOICE---

FUTURE_SAM_09: [static increasing] "The signal's... can't hold... much 
longer. You have to go NOW. Don't make my mistake. Don't—"

[SIGNAL DIES]

FINAL_CHOICE:
  [1] Leave the radio. Go check the generator.
  [2] Stay. Try to re-establish contact.

---ENDING A: SURVIVAL---

[SCREEN: Hallway, walking to generator room]
TEXT: "The walk to the generator room takes forty-seven seconds."
TEXT: "In the beam of your flashlight, you see it immediately."

[TITLE CARD: THE LAST SIGNAL]
[CREDITS]

---ENDING C: THE CONSPIRACY---

[If player found frequency 107.3]

OTHER_VOICE: "You're receiving the signal, aren't you? Don't trust it."

OTHER_VOICE: "That voice isn't you. It's something else. Something that got 
into the wires during the '58 test."

OTHER_VOICE: "There is no future version of you. There's only the Pattern. 
And it wants you to leave your post."

OTHER_VOICE: "Stay at the radio. No matter what happens. Stay at the radio."

[GAME CONTINUES NORMALLY WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE]
