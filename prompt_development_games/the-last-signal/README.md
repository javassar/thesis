### Story

December 14, 1962. 11:47 PM. You're alone on night shift at a remote Arctic research station when a garbled distress signal breaks through the static. As you tune in, the voice becomes clearer—and says things no stranger should know. The signal is coming from yourself, three days in the future, warning you of a disaster you still have time to prevent.

But can you trust it?
