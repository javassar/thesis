1. Title & Hook
Title: Terminal Lucidity Hook: You are a cursor inside a dying man's final unsent email. As the "Writer" types from the outside world, their words manifest as physical objects falling into a digital void. You must push, stack, and delete these words to alter the letter's meaning before the "Send" button is automatically triggered.

2. Core Insight
The game explores the weight of the unsaid. It posits that communication is a struggle against the entropy of thought. To a human player, this represents the anxiety of finding the "right words" and the realization that once something is "sent" into the world, it is permanent. It turns the abstract act of editing into a physical, high-stakes labor.

3. Mechanic-Theme Integration
Primary Mechanic: Semantic Physics. Words fall from the top of the screen as 2D rigid bodies (blocks). The player (a high-velocity cursor) can collide with these blocks to knock them off the "Sent" shelf or rearrange them into new sentences.

Embodiment: The "weight" of the theme is literal. Heavy words like LOVE, GRIEF, or FORGIVE have higher mass and are harder to move than lighter words like AND, THE, or BUT. The player is physically struggling with the gravity of the writer's emotions.

4. Technical Specification
Display: 800x600. A minimalist text-editor aesthetic (white background, monospaced black text).

Input: * Mouse Movement: Controls the cursor (the player). The faster the mouse moves, the more kinetic energy the cursor has to "hit" words.

Left Click: Hold to "Delete" (shrinks a word block until it vanishes).

Game State: * TYPING: The "Writer" (AI) types words at a set cadence. Words fall and settle on a central platform.

FINAL_STRETCH: At 4 minutes, the "Writer" begins typing faster.

TRANSMISSION: At 5 minutes, a giant "SENDING..." progress bar fills the screen, locking all physics.

Assets Needed:

Physics Engine: Phaser's built-in Matter.js or Arcade Physics.

Sound: Mechanical keyboard clicks (varying in pitch/weight), a low digital hum that grows in volume as the 5-minute mark approaches.

                body.gameObject.destroy();
            }
        });
    }

    triggerSend() {
        this.spawnTimer.remove();
        
        // Final Logic: Scan the 'Shelf'
        // Any word object whose Y position is within 50px of the shelf is "Read"
        let finalMessage = "";
        this.currentLetterText.forEach(word => {
            if (word.active && word.y > 450) {
                finalMessage += word.text + " ";
