# Quick Start Guide - Five Minutes

## First Time Playing?

### Finding Yourself
When the game starts, look for:
- A **BRIGHT BLUE** character in the center-bottom area
- The label **"YOU"** floating above it
- A bouncing message saying **"Try moving!"**

That's you! You can't miss it.

### Your First Actions

1. **Move Around** (this makes the hint disappear)
   - Press **W A S D** keys OR **Arrow Keys**
   - Your character will move smoothly
   - Try walking around the village

2. **Talk to Someone**
   - Walk close to any NPC (the labeled circles)
   - Press **SPACE** or **E** when near them
   - Read their dialogue
   - Press **SPACE** again to close

3. **Check Your Thoughts**
   - Press **TAB** at any time
   - Read your journal entries
   - Press **TAB** again to close

### What You'll See

**Your Character (YOU)**:
- Bright blue with white outline
- Larger than NPCs
- Has "YOU" label above
- Impossible to miss!

**NPCs (The Frozen Villagers)**:
- Circles with names like "THE BAKER", "OLD MAN"
- Frozen in place with sparkles
- Talk to each one 3 times for different dialogues

**Objects**:
- Rectangles with labels like "WELL", "MESSAGE BOARD"
- Walk near and press SPACE/E to examine

**The Timer**:
- Top-right corner
- Counts down from 5:00
- This is how long you exist

### Controls (Always Shown at Bottom)

```
WASD/Arrows: Move
SPACE/E: Interact
TAB: Thoughts
ESC: Quit
```

### Tips

- **Move during the intro** - You can explore while the opening text appears
- **Talk to everyone** - Each NPC has 3 different dialogues
- **Write a message** - Find the MESSAGE BOARD and press SPACE
- **Check your journal** - New entries appear as you discover things
- **Watch the timer** - When it hits 0:00, the ending happens automatically

### Common Issues

**"I can't find my character!"**
- Look for the bright blue figure with "YOU" above it
- It's in the center-bottom area when you start
- Try pressing WASD - if you're moving, you found yourself!

**"Nothing happens when I press E!"**
- Make sure you're standing very close to an NPC or object
- Try SPACE instead
- The character name should be right next to yours

**"The dialogue won't close!"**
- Wait for all the text to appear
- Then press SPACE
- Look for "[SPACE to continue]" at the bottom

### The Experience

This game is about:
- Having 5 minutes of consciousness
- Exploring a frozen world
- Talking to NPCs who briefly wake up
- Understanding what you are
- Accepting the inevitable

No matter what you do, the Hero will arrive when the timer hits 0:00.

**Your actions don't change the ending.**

**But they change your journey.**
