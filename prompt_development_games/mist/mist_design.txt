1. Title & Hook
Title: MIST Hook: You aren't the hero; you’re the weather. Wipe away the condensation on a rainy window to reveal the path for a tiny traveler trying to find their way home.

2. Core Insight
The central question: How much of our success is due to our own effort, and how much is due to the unseen hands clearing our path? Human relevance: This game explores caregiving and invisible labor. It places the player in a position of a "silent guardian," emphasizing that sometimes the most important thing you can do for someone is simply to help them see clearly.

3. Mechanic-Theme Integration
Primary Mechanic: Subtractive Masking. The screen is covered in a "mist" layer (a semi-transparent gray). The player uses the mouse (or trackpad) to "wipe" the mist away, revealing the 2D world underneath. Integration: The act of "wiping" the window feels intimate and domestic. As you wipe, you reveal platforms, hazards, and the "Traveler" (an AI-controlled character). If you don't wipe the path ahead, the Traveler hits a wall or falls. The mechanic is the theme: the world is only navigable through your direct, tactile care.

4. Technical Specification
Display Specs
Canvas Dimensions: 800px x 600px.

Background (The World): Deep blues and warm oranges (a cozy city at night).

Mist Layer: Hex #D1D9E0 at 0.9 alpha.

The Traveler: A small, 12px x 20px hooded figure, white (for high contrast).

UI Elements:

Breath Meter: A small icon of a lung at (40, 560). As you "wipe," the meter depletes.

Final Text: Centered upon completion: "They made it home because you noticed."

Fonts: 'Gaegu' or a similar hand-written style font.

Inputs
Mouse Movement (Hold Left Click): Wipes the mist. The "brush" size is 40px.

Spacebar: "Breathe" on the window. This refills the mist in a specific area but restores a small amount of "Energy" (used for pacing).

Game State Information
mistCanvas: A Phaser.Textures.RenderTexture. This acts as the mask.

travelerState: String ('walking', 'waiting', 'falling'). Initial: 'walking'.

stamina: Float, Initial: 100.0. Decreases while wiping; increases when idle.

Win Condition: traveler.x >= world.width.

Lose Condition: None (The traveler simply waits). This ensures a relaxing, 5-minute reflective experience.

Assets Descriptions
Sprites:

Background: A long, scrolling 2D parallax city-scape.

The Traveler: 4-frame walk cycle.

Sounds:

Squeak: The sound of a finger on glass (pitched randomly).

Rain: A constant, low-looping ASMR rain-on-glass track.

Muffled City: Distant traffic sounds that get "clearer" (louder) in areas where the mist is wiped.

5. Implementation Pseudo Code
JavaScript
// MIST - Phaser Technical Implementation

// 1. PRELOAD
function preload() {
    this.load.image('city', 'assets/bg_city.png');
    this.load.spritesheet('traveler', 'assets/traveler.png', { frameWidth: 16, frameHeight: 24 });
}

// 2. CREATE
function create() {
    // The "World" beneath
    this.add.image(400, 300, 'city').setScale(2);
    
    // Create the Traveler AI
    this.traveler = this.physics.add.sprite(50, 450, 'traveler');
    this.traveler.play('walk');

    // THE MIST SYSTEM
    // Create a render texture that covers the whole screen
    this.mist = this.make.renderTexture({ width: 800, height: 600 }, true);
    this.mist.fill(0xD1D9E0, 0.95);
    
    // Set the mist to use 'ERASE' blend mode
    this.brush = this.make.image({ key: 'brush_alpha', add: false });
    this.brush.setScale(0.5);

    // Setup input
    this.input.on('pointermove', (pointer) => {
        if (pointer.isDown && stamina > 0) {
            // This is the core 'Wipe' logic
            this.mist.draw(this.brush, pointer.x, pointer.y, 1, 0, 'ERASE');
            stamina -= 0.5;
        }
    });
}

// 3. UPDATE LOOP
function update(time, delta) {
    // A. Traveler AI Logic
    // Raycast forward from the traveler's position
    let isPathClear = checkMistAlphaAt(this.traveler.x + 20, this.traveler.y);

    if (isPathClear < 0.2) { // If mist is wiped enough
        this.traveler.setVelocityX(80);
        this.traveler.anims.resume();
    } else {
        this.traveler.setVelocityX(0); // Traveler stops and waits for the player
        this.traveler.anims.pause();
    }

    // B. Physics Check
    // If the traveler walks over a hole in the "revealed" city background
    if (!checkPlatformUnder(this.traveler.x, this.traveler.y)) {
        respawnTraveler();
    }

    // C. Stamina Regen
    if (!this.input.activePointer.isDown && stamina < 100) {
        stamina += 0.2;
    }
}

// 4. HELPER: Alpha Check
function checkMistAlphaAt(x, y) {
    // This function samples the RenderTexture to see if the player 
    // has wiped that specific pixel or if it's still "foggy."
    let pixel = this.mist.snapshotPixel(x, y);
    return pixel.alpha;
