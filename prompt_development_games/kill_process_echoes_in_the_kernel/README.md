# Kill Process: The Architecture of Forgetting

This is a short, experimental game about memory and forgetting.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game will start automatically.
3. You are a system utility tasked with cleaning a corrupted mind.
4. Use the following commands to navigate and purge memories:
    - `ls`: Lists the contents of the current directory.
    - `cd [directory]`: Navigates into a directory. Use `cd ..` to go back.
    - `rm -rf [directory]`: Deletes a directory and the memories within it. This is the only way to reduce "System Strain".

## Goal

Your goal is to keep the system from crashing. The "System Strain" is constantly increasing. If it reaches 100%, the system will halt and you will lose.

To win, you must purge all memories from the system.

Good luck.
