The game "Patch Note #0" delivers a genuinely creative and smooth experience. As a
  first-time player, I found the theme, instructions, and visual feedback intuitive and
  engaging. The flickering 'glitch' cursor, clear object highlighting on hover, and visual
  corruption effects effectively convey the core mechanic. The hero's autonomous movement
  allowed me to focus on corruption. Dynamic patching, introducing new platforms and
  anti-gravity zones, provided excellent progression and challenge, forcing adaptation. The
  escalating dev dialogue and 'Live Coding' visual heightened the climax to a satisfying
  'UNINSTALL' ending. I experienced no confusion, unfair difficulty, or lack of reaction time.
  The game's pacing and feedback were excellent, resulting in a frustration-free playtest. No
  changes are needed.
