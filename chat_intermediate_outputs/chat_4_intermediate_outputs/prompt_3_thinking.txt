**Evaluating design revision**

I need to critique the existing game design and identify where it falls short, so I can revise it creatively. The user wants a revised design plan that’s just as detailed, and I’ll need to include both Stage 1 and Stage 2 again. I should also start with a review at the beginning and format everything in a .txt document with sections. It's important to stick to a 5-minute constraint and consider concepts that are more innovative.
