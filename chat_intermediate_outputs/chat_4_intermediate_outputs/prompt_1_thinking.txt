**Generating Creative Game Ideas**

I need to come up with 5 to 10 creative game ideas. Each should have a clear title, a descriptive overview, core mechanics, and a unique hook. They also mentioned using a scratchpad for brainstorming but won’t include that in my output. I should ensure a diversity of genres, mechanics, themes, tones, and innovation levels to keep things fresh and interesting. This sounds like a fun challenge, and I’m excited to get started!
