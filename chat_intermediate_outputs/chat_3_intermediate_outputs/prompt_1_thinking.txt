**Exploring game concepts**

I'm brainstorming various game concepts with unique mechanics. For example, "Orbit Oddity" could be a mix of rhythm and physics, using slingshot satellites around planets. "Witch's Mise en Place" might involve timing and ingredient transmutation in cooking. "Subway Sketch" could allow drawing tracks in real-time with events and commuter personalities. Another idea is "Museum Night Shift," focusing on stealth and puzzles with shadows. I can also explore "Garden of Forking Vines," guiding growth, and "Paper Plane Parliament," juggling political satire. Lastly, "Echo Courier" could use sound-based echolocation in a maze.
