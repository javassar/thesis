**Selecting a game idea**

I need to choose a game idea with the most potential that can be implemented in Phaser within five minutes and have a distinct ending. Many options fit this criteria, but I should pick one with clear mechanics and a short arc. "Cozy Cryptids" stands out as a feasible choice. It’s a hidden-object photo timing game that uses simple mechanics. I’ll integrate themes of patience and observation, allowing players to build a photo album within the five-minute window.
