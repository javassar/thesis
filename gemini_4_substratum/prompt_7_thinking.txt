✦ I have reviewed the game code for bugs and implementation errors.

  Bug Found and Fixed:


   1. Issue: Incorrect strip wrapping logic in the update function when dragging
      strips to the right. The condition strip.group.x > config.width was not
      the correct logical threshold for when the visual content of the strip
      should wrap.
       * Root Cause: The config.width was used as a threshold for wrapping when
         dragging right, which did not correctly account for the repeating
         nature of the strip's content.
       * Fix: The condition else if (strip.group.x > 0) was implemented. This
         ensures that when the strip's container x position moves past its
         initial 0 point (indicating it has been dragged right), it wraps by
         subtracting totalStripLength, effectively shifting the repeating
         content to maintain seamless visual looping.

  No other bugs were found:


   * Page load, initial state, input handling, game logic (collisions, state
     changes), and end conditions were all verified and appear to function as
     intended based on the revised creative plan.
   * The potential issue of win text stacking was determined not to be a bug, as
     the game effectively ends (input disabled, hero/UI destroyed) once the
     final victory condition is met, preventing the message from being added
     multiple times.


  The code review is complete, and the identified bug has been fixed.
