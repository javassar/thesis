Worked for 3m 34s
Findings

High: Paint never spawns and the gate can’t be tuned because source entry / inlet tiles were blocked from editing, leaving them as sand (impassable). Fixed by allowing those tiles in tileIsEditable() so players can carve into the sources and inlet. index.html (line 546).
Assumptions / Questions

Assumed the inlet tile must be carveable to receive color (otherwise the gate can’t ever open).
Changes made

Allowed edits on source entry and inlet tiles by removing the extra lock in tileIsEditable() in index.html (line 546).
