Worked for 3m 42s
Playtest (first‑time, casual)
I see the title screen. I read the “How to Play” panel, then click Start. Okay, I see the glider on the pier and the quick tip overlay. I drag to the right to “aim” a gust. A wind circle pops, but the glider scoots away from the gust center instead of along the drag direction. Wait, I just read “drag to aim” — why isn’t it aiming? I try again with a longer drag. Same thing: it pushes outward from the gust, not along my line. That feels inconsistent and I’m not sure how to control it. CONFUSION: drag direction vs. actual force direction.

I keep going anyway, manage to nudge the glider toward the pinwheel, and it spins enough to open the door. That part feels good once it clicks. I drift toward the lake, see the wind meter draining, and it starts shaking red — okay, I wait a second and it refills.

I press H to reread the instructions. The help overlay shows up, but the glider keeps drifting and I dip into the water while I’m reading. I have to close the overlay quickly and respawn. FRUSTRATION: I expect a help panel to pause the action.

Eventually I get past the lanterns and bridge. The gear area is busy but doable. I reach the lighthouse with some bumps, but those two moments were the only “why did that happen?” points.

Playability issues + fixes

Drag direction doesn’t match wind direction
Player experience: I drag to the right, but the gust pushes away from its center, not along my drag. I feel like the controls are lying to me.
Root cause: applyGustForces uses radial direction from gust center and ignores the drag vector; the drag direction only affects visuals. index.html (applyGustForces, pointerup handler).
Fix: Use the drag direction as the gust’s force direction, and derive torque from wind direction vs. radial. I also add a tap fallback that nudges toward the glider when the drag is tiny. index.html
Help overlay doesn’t pause gameplay
Player experience: I open the help overlay and drift into water while reading.
Root cause: toggleHelpOverlay only toggles visibility; it doesn’t pause physics or the update loop. index.html (toggleHelpOverlay).
Fix: Pause/resume Matter when the help overlay is shown/hidden, without forcing the pause overlay. index.html
Edits are already applied in index.html. If you want, I can do a quick pass to balance gust strength after the directional change.
