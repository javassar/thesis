        if (Phaser.Input.Keyboard.JustDown(this.keys.ESC)) {
        if (!this.helpOverlayVisible && Phaser.Input.Keyboard.JustDown(this.keys.ESC)) {
          this.togglePause();
Worked for 2m 52s
Found one real input-state bug and fixed it; everything else in the checklist looks correct and stable.

Bug: pressing Esc while the help overlay is open would unpause the game but leave the overlay up, so play continues underneath it.
Fix: ignore Esc when the help overlay is visible so the overlay remains the active pause state.

Do a quick in‑browser sanity check.
Verify balance after the directional gust change.
