Worked for 4m 30s
Made a few playability tweaks based on the mental playtest: I moved the first guard deeper into the level and added a short hearing grace period, enforced the resonance door as a real gate with a wall column, and loosened the pillar sync window.

Playtest
"I see the title screen. I press a key. The screen is almost black except a cyan dot and the control hint. I try WASD and I move; tiny cyan blips appear under me. I press Space and a green ring spreads out, revealing a pillar and a small door. I walk toward the pillar. A green triangle shows up and immediately angles toward me and speeds up. I do not really understand why it heard me yet. FLAG: confused about instant guard reaction. It reaches me quickly and I get Caught. I restart. This time I crouch and move slower, and the blips feel smaller. I ping near the pillar and the small door opens, so I slip through. In the stone area I switch to low and the big ring helps me see more; I spot a blue guard and go around him. In the fabric gallery I try high and the ring feels small, so I switch to mid. I reach the metal hall and see two pillars and another door. I ping one and run to the other, but the door does not open in time. FLAG: confused about timing. I notice I can walk around the door entirely through open space. FLAG: unexpected gate bypass. I grab the relic and head back to the exit and win."

Issues and fixes

Early guard catch feels unfair
Player perspective: I get caught within seconds and do not understand why my normal movement is so loud.
Root cause: The green guard starts very close to the spawn, and notifyGuards reacts to footsteps immediately. index.html
Fix: Moved the green guard deeper into the level and added a short hearing grace period at the start. index.html
Resonance door is confusing and optionally bypassed
Player perspective: The two‑pillar door does not open reliably, and I can walk around it anyway.
Root cause: The metal hall is fully open, so the door is not a real chokepoint, and the pillar sync window is tight for a first‑time player. index.html
Fix: Added a wall column that forces a single‑tile passage through the door, and increased the pillar activation range + sync window to make the puzzle readable. index.html
If you want, I can do a second pass with the same playtester persona now that the tweaks are in.
