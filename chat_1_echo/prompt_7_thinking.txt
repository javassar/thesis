Worked for 2m 43s
Fixed guard movement so they no longer walk through closed doors, which could break gate behavior and confuse win/lose pacing.

Findings

Medium: Guards could path through closed doors because movement only checked tile solidity; this let them cross the resonance/tutorial doors even when closed. Fixed by blocking guard movement when their next step is inside a closed door’s bounds. index.html (line 1070)
No other issues found with page load, initial placements, input handling, end conditions, or HUD text visibility.

Changes made:

Added closed‑door bounds checks in isPassable used by guard movement. index.html (line 1070)
Next steps:

Do a quick browser playtest to confirm guards now respect doors.
