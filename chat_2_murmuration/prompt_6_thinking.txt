Playtest Narrative
I see the title screen with drifting dots and a big “MURMURATION” title. The controls line is long but I skim it and press Space. The sky opens up, a cluster of triangle birds appears, and I notice a glowing lure following my mouse. I move the mouse—birds arc toward it with a delay. I hold left-click and the glow swells; the flock tightens and feels more responsive. I tap right-click and they spread slightly.

A ring gate sits ahead with a progress arc. I pull the flock toward it and try to get them through together. The progress fills and the camera pans right to the next section. Wind arrows drift across the sky; the flock starts sliding sideways. I adjust the lure and it mostly holds.

Then the hawk shadow sweeps across. I see the tip about scattering and I try to right-click, but I still linger under the shadow for a moment. Suddenly the flock count drops hard and I lose with “Night falls.”
FLAG: I lose abruptly without understanding how deadly the shadow is; it feels too punishing for a first-time player.

Issues & Fixes

Issue: The hawk shadow can wipe the flock very quickly, causing a sudden loss without clear warning.
Root cause: Each bird has a 12% removal chance every 0.2s immediately upon overlap, which makes the effective per‑second loss rate extremely high. (index.html (line 706))
Fix: Added a 0.6s exposure delay and reduced the per‑tick chance to 5% (2% while scattering). This makes the hazard readable and gives the player time to react. (index.html (line 578), index.html (line 706))
If you want me to run another mental pass after this change (or tune difficulty further), say the word.
