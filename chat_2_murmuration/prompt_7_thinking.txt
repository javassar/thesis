Residual risks / testing gaps

I didn’t run the game in a browser, so input edge cases (e.g., right‑click behavior on trackpads or pointer coordinates before first mouse move) aren’t empirically verified.
Visual overlap/legibility may vary slightly with browser font rendering; a quick manual check would confirm HUD spacing.
